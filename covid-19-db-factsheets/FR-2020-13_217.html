            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            An ordinance to enact “emergency measures” related to short-time working, which was published in France’s official journal on 28 March, temporarily modifies the rules on how certain employees (part-time workers, apprentices and individuals on professional training contracts) are compensated and opens up the system to groups that are normally excluded (public companies, individuals who work from home). It also modifies the rules for employees that do training during the short-time working period as well as short-time working in the case of protected employees (e.g. staff representatives). 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The new ordinance guarantees partial time workers the same rights to minimum monthly remuneration as full-time employees. Apprentices and employees on a professional training contract will be compensated with 100% of their usual remuneration. Employees who during the period of short-time follow a training course are normally compensated by their employer with 100% of their remuneration. For training programmes agreed between employees and employers after the entry into force of this ordinance, employees will only receive 70% of their remuneration. When short-time working is applied for all employees at a company, establishment, department or workshop to which a protected employee is assigned or posted, the employer’s decision is binding on protected employees. As a result, until the end of the health crisis, the employer does not have to obtain the agreement of protected employees to put them on short-time working.
