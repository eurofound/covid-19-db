            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Seimas approved amendments to Labour Code No XII-2603 (Art. 49) allowing an employer to suspend an employee from work in the event of an emergency or quarantine, if the employee's medical condition endangers his or her colleagues, but the employee does not agree to work remotely. Such changes have been adopted to protect workers from persons who are infected with COVID-19, have returned from foreign territories or may have been in contact with persons infected with COVID-19.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Newly adopted Article 49 of the Labour Code stipulates that after the Government of the Republic of Lithuania declares a state of emergency or quarantine, in order to ensure protection of the health of employees and third parties, the employer must offer an employee whose health condition threatens the health of other employees to work remotely. The employer's offer to the employee to work remotely must state the reason, term and legal basis for the offer to work remotely. The employee must inform the employer in writing of the consent to work remotely within one working day. If the employee does not agree to work remotely or fails to respond to the employer's offer to work remotely, the employer suspends the employee from work in writing, prohibiting him/her to work and paying no wage, no later than one working day from the deadline to respond to the employer's offer. The employer's decision to suspend the employee from work must specify the period for which the employee is to be suspended, the reason for the suspension and the legal basis thereof.
