            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            With the Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 (art. 56) the Government intervened in the field of loan payments, in order to prevent, or to mitigate, the indebtedness of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. This is part of a series of measures introduced by the government in order to support entrepreneurial activities that have been affected from the COVID-19 epidemic and to allow them to stay afloat during the crisis.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to support entrepreneurial activities that have been affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises with debt exposures vis-à-vis banks and financial intermediaries can suspend loan installments until 30 September 2020. Furthermore, all subsidized loans can be suspended. Companies eligible for these measures are those whose debt exposures not classified as impaired credit exposures.The operations subject to the support measures are admitted, without evaluation, to the guarantee subsidiary of a special section of the Guarantee Fund for SMEs with a budget of € 1.73 billion which will cover 33% of non-payments of companies to lenders for the duration of the period of suspension.

        <p>
