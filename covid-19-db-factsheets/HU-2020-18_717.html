            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            Under government decree 96, students of higher education and adult education may take out an interest-free loan to offset their living expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure was introduced as part of efforts to help families with little or no savings, as well as seeing students as a group vulnerable to losing their part-time jobs or not finding a job during the pandemic situation. The loan can be requested via the student loans provider Diákhitel Központ until 31 December 2020.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The amount of the interest-free loan for students in higher education is a one-off lump sum of HUF 500,000 (€1,429). Students in adult education courses organised by the Ministry of Innovation are also eligible, they can apply for an interest-free loan of HUF 1.2 million (€3,429). Students will have 12 months before they must start repayment of the loan, which can be over a period of 1 to 5 years, at their discretion. As part of this set of measures targeting students, the rules about losing students’ state scholarships on the basis of academic achievement will be suspended for the duration of the pandemic situation. Higher education students will not be required to pass language examinations during this period, either, and the existing targeted language exam loans will be converted to the new 0% interest loan. There are also suspensions introduced on the repayment of other existing student loans
