            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            This exceptional and temporary measure, set by Decree-Law 10-G/2020 of 26 March, refers to the temporary exemption of payment of Social Security contributions due by employers, in companies in crisis situation. This temporary measure was already provided for in the Ordinance 71-A/2020 of 15 March, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The right to this exemption is also applicable to independent workers who are employers benefiting from the exceptional and temporary measures to protect jobs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to the respective spouses.
        </p>

            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Article 11 of Decree-law 10-G/2020 sets that companies in situation of crisis as a result of:i)	a complete halt in the activity or ii)	an abrupt and sharp decrease of activity of at least 40% of invoicing have access to the temporary exemption of payment of Social Security contributions due by employers. This exemption is conferred for one month, being exceptionally extendable up to three months. The exemption covers the Social Security contributions of the workers and the members of the statutory bodies. The right to this exemption is also applicable to independent workers who are employers benefiting from the exceptional and temporary measures to protect jobs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to the respective spouses. The exemption of payment of contributions in relation to the independent workers determines the pay statement by equivalence and does not remove the obligation of delivery of the quarterly declaration. The employers deliver the autonomous pay statements relating to the workers covered and make the payment of the respective levies.
