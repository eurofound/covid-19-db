            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to provide a temporary relief to the employers facing the economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, the Parliament passed a bill suspending the employee's right to ask a redundancy payment to their employer.The former legal framework, indeed, allowed employees temporarily laid off, or temporarily put on short-time, for a long time, to consider themselves as dismissed, asking the employer to provide them the consequential redundancy payment.This measure has been introduced through 'The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020', which amended the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The measure modified the law about the employees' right to claim redundancy payment from the employer, if temporarily laid off or temporarily put on short-time, solely with reference to the COVID-19 emergency period.Normally, if a worker is laid off or put on short-time hours, he/she can claim the redundancy payment from his/her employer after 4 weeks or more, or 6 weeks in the last 13 weeks.According to this measure, the worker will not be able to claim redundancy payments during the emergency period, if laid off or put on short-time work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The emergency period set out in legislation is 13 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. This period may be, anyway, extended and, after the its end, the legal framework will go back to the former configuration.
