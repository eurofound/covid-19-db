        </h2>
        <p>
            The Joint Decision of the Greek Ministries of Finance, Development and Investment of 2 April 2020 sets a €1 billion aid scheme to support companies affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the European Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The goal of the measure is to sustain companies which saw their business affected and impaired by the provisions adopted to face the pandemic and by their consequential socio-economic effects. (JMD, OJ  1135/Β/02.04.2020)

            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The measure provides companies with a cash advance financed by the Greek State amounting to €1 billion in total. The funds will be provided via the 'taxis' information system as a tax-free amount, which will not be able to be offset or confiscated. This measure is addressed to small and medium enterprises of all economic sectors, that have their seat or permanent establishment in Greece, and employ at least 1 and a maximum of 500 employees, in order to deal with the specific issues that such enterprises face in terms of accessibility to credit. Private companies (general and limited liability companies, limited liability companies and private capital companies) that do not employee personnel, regardless their sector, are also eligible for the return on their advance payments.The advance will be refunded to the Greek State within the next 5 years, either in total or partially, depending on the viability of each enterprise. The first year is a grace period and there is no obligation to any repayment, which will take place in equal monthly installments within the remaining 4 years by applying an extremely low interest rate
