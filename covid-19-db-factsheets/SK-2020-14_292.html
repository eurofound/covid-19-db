            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            Through the Act 66/2020 Coll., the legislator intervened in order to cushion the condition of long-term unemployed in the local labour market. Indeed, as a consequence of the restrictions and the social distancing measures introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, jobseekers are increasingly at risk of not finding a job for a longer period of time. Therefore, the Parliament decided that during the pandemic unemployment benefit should be paid for a longer period.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, the unemployment benefit period has been extended by one month (up to a maximum of 7 months) for those who could not find a job. The measure is finalized to sustain people that remained unemployed up to the end of the original unemployment benefit period. The Government may lay down the conditions for entitlement to the unemployment benefit, the conditions for the payment of the unemployment benefit, the length of the unemployment benefit period and the amount of the unemployment benefit, in the form of a government order for the duration of the crisis and for two months after its termination.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Use of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Compared to the current legal situation, it is expected that approximately 28.1 thousand more unemployment benefits will be paid out by 2020, with an average monthly rate of around EUR 518.1. Expenditure on the basis of these assumptions is expected to be around EUR 14.6 million in 2020
