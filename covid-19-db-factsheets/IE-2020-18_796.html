        <p>
            The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) has proposed this scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability.The fund will be administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of DBEI with a total fund size of €2 million. Applications for funding will be invited through a public call for submission of projects. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project eligible costs with a maximum grant of €40,000.

        <p>
            The purpose of this fund is to enable Irish-owned retailers to enhance their digital capability and to develop a more competitive online offer, that will enable an increase in their customer base and build a more resilient business in the domestic and global marketplace both online and offline. Typical elements involved in developing a sophisticated and transactional online presence include research, consultancy costs for strategy development, implementation and training.The applicant must be an Irish-owned retail enterprise that had 10 or more employees on or before 29 February 2020 and has the potential to sustain or create jobs, generate growth in online transactions and has an ambition to internationalise their business in future. The business must also:- have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media);- have a retail outlet and derive the majority of revenue from the retail outlet(s);Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. The minimum grant amount payable is €10,000 under this Scheme.
