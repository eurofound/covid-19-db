        </h2>
        <p>
            The main part of the yearly wage settlements in Norway take place during the spring months. On Friday 13 March 2020 the front runners in the negotiations, The Norwegian United Federation of Trade Unions (Fellesforbundet) and The Federation of Norwegian Industries (Norsk Industri), agreed to postpone negotiations on the collective agreements until August 2020. The reason was the situation that has arisen in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. This lead to agreement among all other parties as well, to postpone the negotiations in the wage settlement of 2020 to the autumn. In an understanding between the National Mediator and the main organisations, all mediation was postponed until September 2020.

            On Friday, March 13, The Norwegian United Federation of Trade Unions (Fellesforbundet) and The Federation of Norwegian Industries (Norsk Industri), agreed to postpone the negotiations on the Industry Agreement until August 2020, due to the Covid-19 crisis. Negotiations will be reopened on August 3, 2020 and the agreement will be prolonged until August 21, 2020. The leader of Fellesforbundet Jørn Eggum said this is the only responsible thing to do in this situation, and he argued the parties will be able to uphold the principles of Norwegian wage formation althoug such postponement never has taken place before. The postponement of the negotiations on the Industry Agreement lead to agreements among all the other parties to postpone their negotiations as well. The National Mediator Mats Wilhelm Ruland informed in a press release that he - in understanding and consultation with all the main organisations - has decided to postpone the start of this year's mediations until autumn 2020. In practice, this means that all the renegotiations of nationwide collective agreements are postponed until there is a settlement in the Industry Agreement that is the leading sector. Until then, the tariff agreements for the period 2018-2020 will continue to apply. Such a delay is unique in Norway and shows that there is considerable financial uncertainty associated with the situation that has arisen. At the same time, it would also be practically demanding to conduct negotiations given the measures that have been taken to avoid infection of Covid-19.
