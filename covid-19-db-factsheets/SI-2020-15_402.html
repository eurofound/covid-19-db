            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            The 'Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act' (ZIUZEOP), adopted on 2 April 2020, alleviate the negative consequences of the epidemic on companies, exempting them from paying sick leave compensations in the period from 11 April to 31 May 2020 (Article 56). Normally, employers are paying compensations for the first 30 days of sick leave, and the Health Insurance Institute covers those exceeding 30 days of sick leave.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the reference period, an insured person has the right to the sick leave compensation paid by the Health Insurance Institute since the very first day of sick leave. The level of compensation usually depends on the reason for sick leave: it is, for instance, determined at 100% for workplace injuries and 80% for illness. The Intervention act (ZIUZEOP) envisages higher compensation levels for infected persons: 90% compensation for those who, according to doctor’s instruction, have to be isolated, 100% for those who get infected at the workplace. Healthy persons are not entitled to sick leave compensation: belong to this category parents who have to look after small children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; persons who cannot come to work due to the suspension of public transport or border crossing; persons with chronic diseases; and healthy persons who have been in contact with infected people.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Use of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The measure addresses companies as well as self-employed persons, but not organizations directly or indirectly financed by the state budget. The ultimate date until which companies or self-employed persons may request for sick leave compensations from the Health Insurance Institute is 30 September 2020.

            Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted proposals to the law. In the case of this measure, they requested only some specifications. The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. Its functioning, indeed, is momentarily blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, has not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council.
