        <p>
            In addition to personal and political freedoms and rights, economic and cultural rights, and the right to a healthy life, social welfare rights are protected by the Constitution and other regulations. There are almost 19 thousand employees in social welfare institution. These are institutions for child care, care and support for older people, care and support for people with disabilities, people with mental health problems, substance abuse, homelessness and other. Due to the adverse circumstances, there was a need to improve the coordination of the work of social welfare institutions.

            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            This Decision establishes the coordination of the work of social welfare institutions founded by the Republic of Croatia or a unit of local and regional self-government and social service providers with whom the Ministry for Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy has concluded a cooperation agreement on the provision of social services throughout the Republic of Croatia and the joint operation of all institutions and other social service providers. A Ministry of Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy is authorized to manage and coordinate the work of all institutions and other providers of social services.
