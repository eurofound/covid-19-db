        <p>

            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            On 10 March, with 89 confirmed cases and no deaths in the country, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed - only certain businesses, such as supermarkets, food stores, pharmacies and kiosks have been permitted to remain open. Similarly, all services in all areas of religious worship, of any religion or dogma, were suspended. On 23 March, all travel outside the home restricted, unless you are working in essential services or making quick trips to buy food or medicine. Greeks nowadays require a government-issued "Certificate of Citizens' Movement"  — which can be downloaded from the internet and get printed — to show police if you are caught outside your house. The closure for schools and educational institutes is now extended till 10 May whereas, for the rest  above mentioned till 27 April.
