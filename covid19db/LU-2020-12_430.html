            </h2>
            <p>
                Based on the law of 3 April 2020 on the introduction of an aid scheme for businesses in temporary difficulty/loi du 3 avril 2020 relative à un régime d'aide en faveur des entreprises en difficulté temporaire, this legal framework aims to provide refundable aids to self-employed persons holding a business permit and established in Luxembourg in craft, commercial and industrial businesses. Self-employed activities include, for example, lawyers, doctors, artists, scientists, engineers or journalists.  
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                This measure aims at all self-employed persons holding a business permit and who are established in Luxembourg. In the case of mixed activities where one activity is exercised beyond self-employment, only eligible activities are covered by this aid (agricultural activities are not covered) on condition that the activities or their costs are kept separate.Refundable costs by the measure include both staff and rental costs for the COVID-19 epidemic period running from 15 March to 15 May 2020. Staff costs comprise both income from a professional activity and income paid by an association or company. The aid is capped at an amount equivalent to 2.5 times the social minimum wage per person concerned. Rental costs are capped at  €10,000 per month per single undertaking. The law stipulates 4 prerequisites for the aid to be applied: the self-employed business must have financial problems during the defined period; the business must fall within the professions defined by the legislation; the business must have exercised its activities already before the crisis; and there must be a causal link between the business' financial difficulties and the COVID-19 epidemic period.
