            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Ministry of Finance has decided to follow Norges Bank's advice to reduce the countercyclical capital buffer requirement for banks from 2.5 to 1 per cent with immediate effect. In Norges Bank's estimation, there is a risk of a marked setback in the Norwegian economy as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The buffer requirement is lowered to counteract a tightening of lending practices in the banks. The social partners have been consulted regularly during design and implementation of the measure.

        <p>
            Norges Bank’s Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee has decided to advise the Ministry of Finance to reduce the buffer rate to 1.0 percent. Norges Bank shall advice the Ministry of Finance on the level of the countercyclical capital buffer for banks. The countercyclical capital buffer rate is currently 2.5 percent. In recent weeks, there has been considerable financial market volatility. The outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19) and the measures to limit contagion will have a significant negative impact on growth in the Norwegian economy. There is substantial uncertainty about the duration and the consequences of the outbreak, with a risk of a pronounced economic downturn. Norwegian banks are solid. They have sufficient capital to absorb losses in the event of a severe downturn. A tightening of lending standards may, however, amplify the downturn in the economy. Against this background, the Committee has decided to advise the Ministry of Finance to reduce the buffer to 1.0 percent with immediate effect. The decision was unanimous.
