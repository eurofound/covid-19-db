                In view of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact upon business, and following consultation with social partners, the government initially announced a package of measures which included the deferral of taxes and financial support to incentivise telework. Following this announcement, employer associations publicly announced that these were insufficient and would not protect their businesses or jobs, stating the government instead needed to subsidise wages. These calls continued when on the 18th March, the government announced futher measures including support for those who had lost their job, the disabled, and for employers to subsidise quarantine leave. On the 24th of March, the government announced a third package of measures which included support for wages and other measures previously announced. The current measure emerged following this conference. This third package of measures was announced by the government whilst flanked by union and employer association members. It was announced that this package was the result of tripartite consultation. Furthermore, following announcement of these futher measures, employer associations announced their satisfaction with the package.
