            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            In certain situations self-employed can qualify for the temporary COVID-19 bridging right:1. If the federal government has obliged the self-employed to interrupt the activity in whole or in part they are immediately eligible for the bridging right. There is no minimum duration of interruption required. This concerns, for example, self-employed who are obliged to close their business (such as restaurants, cafés and non-food businesses). Restaurants providing or delivering takeaway meals are also covered.2. If the government has not obliged the self-employed to interrupt their activity partially or completely, but the self-employed is forced to interrupt their activity for a period of at least 7 consecutive calendar days as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, for example for self-isolation, a lack of raw materials or for various reasons of economic or organisational nature (linked to COVID-19), then they are also eligible for the bridging right.This includes self-employed exercising a care profession such as physiotherapists, dentists and medical specialists.
        </p>

            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Certain conditions apply in order to be able to benefit from the bridging right. The person has to be self-employed as main profession (including helpers, assisting spouses in the maxi-status and (primo-starters); or self-employed as secondary profession with provisional social security contributions that are at least equal to the minimum contributions for self-employed persons in their main profession.The person has to be self-employed and pay social security contributions in Belgium;The person must not receive a replacement income.The Corona bridging right amounts to (for March and April) :€1,291,69 without family responsibilities;€1,614.10 with family responsibilities.If granted, the bridging right for March will be paid at the beginning of April and for April, at the beginning of May.
