                Due to the exceptional health emergency situation, companies and the self-employed have had to suspend their activity or have seen it considerably reduced.

The accrual period in the case of companies would be between April and June 2020, while in the case of the self-employed it would be between May and July 2020. And, in this area, companies and freelancers are allowed who do not have deferments in payment of debts with Social Security can request the deferment of payment of their debts with Social Security, which must enter between the months of April and June 2020, with a substantial reduction in the required interest rate which is set at 0.5%.
