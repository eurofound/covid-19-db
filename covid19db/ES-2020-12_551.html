        <p>
            In order to help companies to maintain their activities and stay afloat, the government approved in those cases where the company is under a temporary collective dismissal procedure or applies reduced working time schemes, a tax exemption from social security contributions of employees.This exemption will not have effects for the worker, that will maintain the consideration of this period as effectively worked for all purposes, and therefore all social contributions will be considered as paid.

        <p>
            In the cases of suspension of contracts and reduction of working hours authorized based on temporary force majeure linked to COVID-19 defined in article 22, the General Treasury of Social Security will exempt the company from the payment of the business contribution provided in article 273.2 of the Consolidated Text of the General Law of Social Security, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 8/2015, of October 30, as well as the one regarding quotas for joint collection concepts, while the period of suspension of contracts or reduction of authorized working hours based on said cause when the company, on February 29, 2020, had fewer than 50 workers registered with Social Security. If the company had 50 workers or more, registered with Social Security, the exemption from the obligation to contribute will reach 75% of the business contribution.
