            <p>
                This measure is part of the package of emergency solutions to deal with the COVID-19. This was a package of several measures which have been taken to contrast the outbreak and its effects, announced on March 17th, 2020.This measure aims to help small farms and farmers to keep their businesses afloat. It targets enterprises in the horti- and agricultural sectors as a whole because this sector was one of the first to feel a marked hit from the crisis. This includes the provision of food and other grown products, not just for domestic consumption but also for trade. The seasonality of work in this sector and the timing of the COVID-19 crisis seem to have led to this group of enterprises receiving specific support.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The sectors covered here by this measure include the agriculture and horticulture sector, the fisheries sector, and the aquaculture sector. These sectors are all confronted by an international and domestic decrease in demand for their produce.The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit - LNV), will therefore temporarily underwrite working capital granted to farms and horticultural companies under the the Guarantee for Agricultural SME Credit, (Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten), which is part of the Guarantee SME Loans scheme for small and medium-sized farms and enterprises.In this way, the government will act as a guarantor for loans granted to farms. The government seeks to ensure that the scope of this scheme will be broadened in the short term. Enterprises can seek credit to bridge their troubled times of up to €15 million, for which the Ministry of LNV will act as guarantor for up to 70%. The credit will be for a maximum of 2 years. This measure was set to stay into force for 3 months initially, but the timing for COVID-19-related measures is constantly evolving and this may change.

                (Though not discussed in great detail, the social partners (national level trade unions and employer organisations), have come together to discuss with the government how best to tackle the effects of the corona virus on workers and employers so as to keep the Dutch economy going. In the Netherlands relevant, national sectoral social partners are often involved in national policy making in a consultational capacity so that partners may reflect on regulatory plans and their intended impacts. This happens in a direct consultation fashion or through tripartite meetings (facilitated by the National Labour Foundation). The social partners were consulted for the whole package of measures introduced by the Dutch cabinet on March 17th 2020.)
