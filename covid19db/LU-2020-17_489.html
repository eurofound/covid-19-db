            <p>
                The Ministry of the Economy, in collaboration with Luxinnovation, has launched a new call for projects for young innovative companies under the name "StartupsVsCovid19". Existing start-ups in Luxembourg are invited to submit projects relating to the development of innovative, technological products or services intended to limit, or even overcome, the economic, health and societal effects of the crisis linked to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The regulatory background is based on crisis march 2020 grand-ducal legislation. The measure does not have a specific legal background, as far as could be identified.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Project proposals under this call of projects can be submitted from 20 April until 30 April 2020 via the website https://www.startupluxembourg.com/startups-vs-covid19, where all information to participate in the call for projects is available. A jury, made up of representatives from the Ministry of the Economy, Luxinnovation, Technoport, the Luxembourg-City Incubator, the House of Startups and the LHoFT, will proceed to a preselection of projects on 7 May.The final selection will be made after hearings of the pre-selected start-ups by video conference on 14 May. The selected projects will be announced around mid-May and must be executed within the presented budget.Up to 20 projects will be selected, which each will benefit from financial support up to €150,000.A first financial part of 75% will be released as soon as the selection has been made official. The remaining 25% of the financial part will be paid after the project has been finalised.
