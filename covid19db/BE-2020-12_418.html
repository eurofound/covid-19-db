            </h2>
            <p>
                This new premium is aimed at companies and their suppliers who are allowed to continue working or shops that remain open but have a large loss of turnover due to the restrictive measures. They have to be able to show that they have a loss of sales of -60% in the period between 15 March and 30 April 2020 compared to the same period last year.For start-ups, a decrease in turnover of -60% compared to the financial plan laid down will be taken into account. NPOs are also eligible, provided that at least one person is employed full time.

            <p>
                Enterprises and their suppliers that are still working or businesses that remain open but suffer a large loss of turnover as a result of the measures are eligible for a compensation premium from the Flemish government. This is the case for, for example:1. Companies in the events sector, with many freelancers2. Para-medical professions such as physiotherapists, dentists, psychologists or speech therapists who are only permitted to carry out urgent interventions3. Specialised food and drink shops, such as chocolate and wine shops, that suffer a heavy loss of turnover due to lack of passage or tourists4. Painters, electricians and plumbers who are only allowed to carry out urgent repairs5. Farmers targeting catering customersThe compensation premium amounts to €3,000. For a certain category of self-employed, as secondary occupation, the compensation is €1,500.The corona compensation premium is a one-off premium.

            <p>
                The exact amount of beneficiaries is currently unclear as the businesses have to apply for it themselves based on their turnover rates. The concrete numbers will only be known at a later stage. It is to be expected however that there will be a significant amount of applications, especially in the events sector.
