        <p>
            The order of the Head of the Civil Protection Department No. 658 of the 29 March 2020 approved the allocation of €400 million to the municipalities to cover urgent measures of food solidarity in the form of direct provision to citizens in need of food products and staple products or vouchers for their purchase. This measure was undertaken as a response to the economic situation resulting from the consequences of the COVID-19 emergency and the lack of other economic support for some segments of the population.

        <p>
            Through an order of the Head of the Civil Protection Department, €400 million were allocated to municipalities in order to support people and families in situation of financial distress due to the economic consequences of the Covid-19 emergency. The funds aim at providing municipalities with the resources needed for the supply of food and staple products to people in need, through their direct provision by the municipalities or the issuing of vouchers to be expended in selected shops. Criteria for the selection of the beneficiaries are left by the ordinance to the single municipalities, which also define the concrete modalities of distribution.
