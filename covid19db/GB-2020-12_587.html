            </h2>
            <p>
                The measures - mortgage holidays and the prevention of eviction from residential tenancies in relation to COVID-19 - are part of the measures announced by the Chancellor on the 17th of March, in addition to his Budget 2020 pledges. The protection from eviction - set to last for at least three months - is set in statute in Section 81 of the Coronavirus Act 2020.
            </p>

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Under the new measure, if a person is experiencing financial difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments because of COVID-19, they may be entitled to a mortgage or rental holiday for 3 months. This includes landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19. Where a tenant is experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19, the government will ensure they do not face the threat of eviction for at least 3 months:• The government has agreed with mortgage lenders that they will offer repayment holidays of 3 months to households in financial difficulty due to COVID-19.• This will also apply to landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.• The offer of a payment holiday can be made available to customers who are up to date with payments and not already in arrears.• Customers who are concerned about their current financial situation should contact their lender at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss whether this is a suitable option for them.• Under the Coronavirus Act, landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a 3 month period. This applies to private and social renters.• At the end of this period, landlords and tenants will be expected to work together to establish an affordable repayment plan, taking into account tenants’ individual circumstances.

                The measure first applied only to those with mortgages. There was widespread criticism, including from the TUC, that tenants would not be similarly helped, particularly when landlords are to benefit from mortgage holidays.
