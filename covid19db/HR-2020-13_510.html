            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            Croatian supermarkets usually tend to have limited amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables. Therefore, farmers market is a good place to pick up seasonal fruit and vegetables and they are quite popular in the whole country. Farmers from surrounding villages come to sell their home-made foodstuffs and fresh fruit and vegetables, really picked up recently. There are also butchers, fishmongers and sellers of milk products. With the goal to prevent mingling of population and the spreading of virus, there was a need to specify the work and functioning of farmers markets. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to ensure the viability of Croatian production and necessary supplies of consumers, this Decision allows, strictly respecting needed measures of social distance, the operation of closed facilities within the markets (shops and kiosks) in which are sold: food; hygiene articles; medicines; veterinary medicinal products; agricultural medicines and animal feed. Legal or natural persons operating the markets are obliged to ensure that there are no crowds at entrances to or in front of shops and kiosks and/or entrances to closed markets, as well as in the premises of closed markets. Furthermore, they should apply measures of enhanced hygiene and daily cleaning of all premises. Finally, they should organize work so as to ensure the greatest possible distance between workers and customers, while respecting strict measures of social distance.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Use of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Possible mitigation of measures regarding farmers markets can be quite positive from the stand point of purchase food and opportunities for farmers to sell their products other articles, However, it can also be a wrong message to the population that the danger has passed away. Positive is the obligation of responsible bodies to provide checkpoints with hand disinfectants in customer premises. Moreover, there is an obligation to provide brief information on general measures to reduction of the risk of infectious diseases.
