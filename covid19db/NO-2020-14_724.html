            </h2>
            <p>
                The outbreak of viruses and measures introduced to prevent infection have had major effects in the labour market, and several measures have been implemented to ensure income for those affected. The Storting (parliament) asked the government to introduce a temporary scheme for self-employed and freelancers who are now losing all or part of their income base as a result of the corona pandemic. The regulation (FOR-2020-04-08-735) takes effect immediately and the payments will be disbursed as soon as NAV gets a technical solution in place for the scheme.
            </p>

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                A compensation scheme for self-employed persons and freelancers who have lost all, or part of their income was approved by the government on 8 April. The new temporary scheme covers up to 80 per cent of income, limited up to an annual income of 6G (approx. EUR 50700) (1G = the basic amount in the national insurance), and applies to income that does not entitle to unemployment benefit. The scheme includes those who have lost income on or after March 16. The compensation is given from day 17 after the loss of income. One must apply in arrears for the loss of income the month before, so that The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration will know about any income for the month in which the application applies. Generally, the basis for compensation for freelancers is calculated on the basis of an average of the income reported to the Tax Administration via the current “a-scheme” in the last 12 months before March 2020. A shorter period can be used for newly established freelancers. Generally, the basis for compensation to self-employed persons is calculated on the basis of business income over the past three income years. The application is due in early May. The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration is already in the process of creating a digital solution that allows payments to be made automatically. The application is due in early May. Those applying for the new scheme will receive detailed guidance along the way in the application process.
