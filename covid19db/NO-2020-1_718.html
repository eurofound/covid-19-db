                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                The government lifted the air passenger tax for flights in the period from 1 January 2020 through 31 October, 2020. The measure is expected to have little impact on the volume of flights. However, the measure is intended as a temporary relief for the airlines during the outbreak of the coronavirus. The purpose of the tax is primarily to provide the state with revenue, but the tax can have an environmental impact by reducing the demand for flights. The Ministry points out that tourism in general and aviation in particular are severely affected by the virus outbreak. Maintaining a fiscal charge on air travel can help exacerbate the negative financial consequences of the virus outbreak.
            </p>

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The duty to pay air passenger tax is incurred when the flight starts from a Norwegian airport, and the fee is calculated per passenger who commences taxable flight from a Norwegian airport. The cancellation of the tax in the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 October 2020 means that the tax will be abolished both for flights made earlier this year and for flights commenced in the period up to and including 31 October 2020. The time of purchase of the air ticket is of no significance for the duty to pay. Flights starting on or after 1 November 2020 will be subject to tax. It follows from the proposal that the fee paid for flights earlier this year should be repaid to the airlines.
