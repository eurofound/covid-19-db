            </h2>
            <p>
                Parental leave legislation has been regarded in Luxembourg as a fundamental policy to address certain employment challenges. During the current COVID-19 crisis and based on the current March 2020 COVID-19 grand-ducal legislation with the objective to keep essential services functioning, the government decided in March 2020 to change the currently applied parental leave legislation, which gives parents the opportunity to interrupt the leave during the COVID-19 period for professional reasons.

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Due to the current situation related to the coronavirus COVID-19, parents are exceptionally allowed to interrupt the current parental leave schemes for the following reasons: - if it is a professional obligation;- if there is a necessity to resume professional activity.The interruption is regarded by the government to be motivated by an external cause, so that allowances already received are not to be reimbursed by the concerned parents.At the end of the interruption, subject to the agreement of the employer if you are an employee, take the portion of the parental leave remaining at the time of the interruption.To request the interruption of parental leave, a form has to be completed and send to the Children's Future Fund (Caisse pour l'Avenir des Enfants - CAE).
