            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            On 17 March 2020, the Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted a Conclusion outlining 63 economic measures aimed at stimulating job retention and addressing illiquidity issues for those whose business activities are reduced by the coronavirus epidemic. The first group of measures consists of measures that are horizontal in nature and aimed at preserving the stability of the economy through the provision of stand-by arrangements and new liquidity. The second set of measures relates to sector measures, both vertically and horizontally oriented, with the aim of encouraging everyone to undertake activities aimed at preserving jobs. As the coronavirus epidemic continues to strongly affect economic activity, the government adopted a second package of measures aimed at alleviating the problem of illiquidity for those entrepreneurs whose business activity was reduced due to the epidemic, while preserving jobs and employment.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            With this Decision, the Government of the Republic of Croatia reallocates funds within the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia for 2020 (OG 171/19) in order to remedy the consequences of the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic. The funds are reallocated in the amount HRK 2,101,570,660 (€ 280,209,421.3). Almost 90 percent of the reallocated funds, or HRK 1.87 billion, is intended to implement a job preservation measure for employers who have distorted economic activity, due to the special circumstance caused by the coronavirus epidemic. For the implementation of the measures by the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Hrvatska banka za obnovu i razvoj - HBOR) related to the approval of new liquidity loans to economic entities, HRK 80 million was provided.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Use of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Next to the previously mentioned purposes, reallocated funds will be used to finance various other needs. HRK 53.2 million have been planned for the procurement of equipment for microbiological diagnostics of the corona virus, protective equipment and disinfectants and for on-call duty within the Croatian Institute for Public Health's Infectious Epidemiology Service. HRK 40 million is reserved for the implementation of the measure for the preservation of employment in legal entities in the sports system. For grants to independent artists, self-employed and natural and legal persons in the cultural and creative industries, as well as to provide funds for approved cultural projects HRK 34 million is planned. Aid of HRK 25 million was allocated for support measures for programs for financing variable (business) capital and improving the liquidity of vulnerable tourism entrepreneurs, and HRK 20 million was allocated to assist the agricultural sector due to traffic restrictions and increased handling costs.
