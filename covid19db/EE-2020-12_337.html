            </h2>
            <p>
                Solo self-employed are obliged to pay social tax four times during the year as advance payments at the end of every quarter in the amount of at least the minimum social tax obligation (in 2020, €534.6 per quarter). The final tax liability based on their business income is calculated the next year based on the income tax declaration. As several solo self-employed are in difficult position due to the restrictions, the measure is seen as a soothing measure to avoid tax arrears and economical difficulties for the sole proprietors.
            </p>

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                To help the solo self-employed persons, the state pays the social tax advanced payment for the first quarter of 2020 to the solo self-employed's prepay account in the Tax and Customs Board. It is possible to use the payment for the first quarter payment of the social tax. If the payment for the first quarter is already done by the solo self-employed the payment can be used for the payment of any tax liability now or in the future, or transfer the money to their bank account and use it for other business costs. The size of the payment is €534.6.
