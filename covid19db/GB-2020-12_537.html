        <p>
            Generally individuals, including the self-employed, who file an annual tax return under self assessment are required to make two ‘payments of account’ during the year, which are advance payments on their tax bill: by 31 January and by 31 July. However, in his statement on the 20 March, the Chancellor announced that Chancellor announced that the next self-assessment payments would be deferred until January 2021.The self assessment payment on account, that is ordinarily due to be paid to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) by 31 July 2020 may now be deferred until January 2021.The deferment is optional and any persons who wish to pay their second self-assessment payment on account on 31 July 2020 may do so. This is an automatic offer with no applications required. No penalties or interest for late payment will be charged if someone defers payment of their July 2020 payment on account until January 2021.The Coronavirus Act 2020 is relevant, in particular Section 76, which refers to the functions of HMRC.
