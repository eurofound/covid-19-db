            <p>
                The 'Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act' (ZIUZEOP), adopted by the National Assembly on 2 April 2020, endows retirees and other vulnerable groups with the right to one-time solidarity allowance. The measure aims at preventing social hardship of persons with low incomes under the condition that they are permanent residents in Slovenia. Allowances vary with social groups and their revenues. The measure reaches the following social groups: retirees, unemployed disabled persons, recipients of social benefit, students, and big families.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                The main subjects eligible for the 'one-time solidarity allowance' are retirees and unemployed disabled persons with the income below € 700/month. The bonus varies with the income which a person receives: it is €300 for pensioners with €500 per month and less, €230 for those with pensions between €500.01 and €600, and €130 for those with pensions between €600.01 and €700. Recipients of social benefits and regular students are entitled to one-time support of €150. All persons concerned will receive a bonus by the end of April. The ‘One-time solidarity allowance’ is exempted from taxes, social security contributions, and income tax. For the duration of the epidemic, large families will receive €100 (families with three children) or €200 bonus (with four children or more).

            <p>
                One-time solidarity bonus goes to vulnerable social groups whose situation particularly worsened due to epidemics: retirees and unemployed disabled persons with income below €700 per month as well as recipients of social benefits and students. Large families exceptionally receive a bonus every month until the end of the epidemic.

                Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted proposals to the law. Employer organizations had no remarks linked to this measure. Trade unions proposed that also other groups in precarious employments would receive one-time solidarity allowance. This proposal was, anyway, not accepted.The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. Its functioning is, indeed, momentarily blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, has not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council.
