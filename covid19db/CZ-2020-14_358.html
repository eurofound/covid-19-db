            Background information
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the COVID-19 outbreak a lot of Czech companies face problems with an actual engagement of their employees. The Czech Chamber of commerce decided to help overcome difficulties and offers a helping hand in using an „employee sharing“ programme. Employee sharing, as an employment tool may be useful since there are also companies that currently lack employees  (e.g. due to quarantine or taking care of their family members) and that would welcome assistance of employees coming from other companies.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Content of measure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The measure is governed by the §43a of the Labour Code, the so called temporary assignment of an employee. The temporarily assigned employee stays employed by the original employer, however, the work tasks are being given by the company to which he/she was assigned. Working and wage conditions of employees temporarily performing activities for another employer must not be worse than the conditions of their main occupation. The Czech Chamber of Commerce  cooperates with an electronic platform  www.WorkLinks.com which offers its services for free for this purpose. Also on-line platform Jurent CZ, which has a wealth of experience in employee sharing, has been involved in this measure. In addition, the Chamber offers a toll free phone helpline for companies requiring advice in that matter.
