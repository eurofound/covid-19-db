            <p>
                On 9 March 2020 government adopted amendments to Cabinet Regulations No. 165, introducing an additional children-related bonus for employees receiving allowance for idle time. Allowance for idle time in general is described in Section 14 of the law “On Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Threat to the State and Its Consequences Due to the Spread of COVID-19” (adopted on 20 March 2020, valid from 22 March 2020).The conditions of eligibility for the allowance are set by the Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 165 “Regulations Regarding the Employers Affected by the Crisis Caused by COVID-19 which are Eligible for the Allowance for Idle Time and Division of the Payment for Late Tax Payments in Installments or Deferral Thereof for up to Three Years”.

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                An employee who receives the allowance for idle time is granted also with an additional bonus of the amount of €50 for each dependent child in age 24 years old if, at the moment of awarding the allowance for idle time the personal income tax relief for the child is applied to the employee. The additional payment is made by the State Social Security agency for the period in which the employee is entitled to the idle time allowance.The State Social Security agency is informed about the persons receiving the allowance for the idle time from the State Revenue Service. The additional payment is transferred to the employee's bank account to which the idle time allowance is transferred.In addition, entitlements to the parental benefit expiring during the state of emergency are extended for the duration of the state of emergency (capped at €700) for persons who are not able to return to work and gain income due to the emergency circumstances.
