            </h2>
            <p>
                On 20 March, the Airbus Group signed an agreement that was supplemented on 26 March with an addendum treating unworked time (hours and days) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The addendum sets out a production suspension regime for the period running from 23 March to 5 April and defines ‘arrangements for a gradual resumption of activity out to the end of 2020, in line the needs of the different company’s divisions sectors and their individual workloads’
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                This agreement qualifies as unworked time the hours and the days not worked during the weeks from 23 March to 5 April 2020, following the collective judgment or limitation of certain activities in the Group as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.The agreement was signed by Donald Fraty, head of human resources France and the trade unions organisations represented at national level and in the Group level. Recovery by hours worked on weekdays, Saturdays and/or days holidays, will be planned by managers according to an indicative calendar between the end of the crisis and 30 June 2021. By way of derogation, each employee may recover hours or days lost, up to 3 maximum days, by using days of leave available in the counters of employees concerned (statutory holidays, RTT, CET, ATC, CETC, modulation fund, etc. according to entities).This possibility will be open to each employee at the end of 2020.The manager may at the same time, by derogation and if he considers that part of the remaining recovery will not be possible in the first half of 2021, authorize the use of days off beyond 3 days to recover the hours and days lost.
            </p>

                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Any bonuses or ancillary wages, which were due with regard to the scheduling of work during this period of collective work interruption, will be maintained. An assessment will be made at the end of the first half of 2021 to ensure that all lost hours and days have been recovered in working time or through the use of rest counters.
