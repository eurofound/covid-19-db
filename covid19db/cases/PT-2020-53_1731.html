                                        This reinforcement of liquidity, which translates into a doubling of the support already granted, equivalent to the value of the incentive calculated for the last quarter of 2020, aims to improve the liquidity conditions of companies to meet short-term commitments, contributing to their subsistence during and after the pandemic outbreak. For companies with a turnover drop of more than 50%, this support can amount to €7,500 for ENIs without organised accounts, €41,250 for micro-enterprises, or €101,250 for eligible small, medium and large enterprises. If the drop is between 25% and 50%, the support can reach €5000, €27,500 or €67,500 respectively. This measure applies retroactively to approved applications and the adjustment of the amounts to be received will be done automatically.
