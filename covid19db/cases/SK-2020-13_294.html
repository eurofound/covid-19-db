                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                With regard to protection against the expansion of COVID-19, the government ordered the closure of all schools, including pre-school facilities. During this period of quarantine, one parent must remain with the children. So far, the nursing benefit has been paid only for 10 calendar days. The Act. 63/2020 Coll. extends the period of payment of this benefit to the whole period of closure of a school or pre-school facility.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                According to this COVID-19 related measure, the entitlement to the nursing benefit arises from the first day of the need for personal and full-time treatment of a close person and only expires on the day the need for his/her personal and full-day treatment ends (and not as previously, for a maximum of 10 days). The condition of receiving the nursing benefit is that the beneficiary treats a child under 16 years of age all day, whose health condition, as confirmed by the relevant doctor, necessarily requires treatment by another natural person. The benefit is also paid if the beneficiary cares for the child until the age of eleven (up to 18 years of age with long-term adverse health conditions), when the child has been ordered to quarantine or isolate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefit shall also be paid if the pre-school or social care facility in which the child is being provided, or the school the child attends, has been closed by decision of the competent authorities or has been subject to a quarantine measure. Another case of eligibility arises when the insured person cares for a close relative, sibling, spouse, spouse or parent of the spouse if the social service facility in which such a person is provided with social services in an outpatient or residential form is as a result of a decision by the competent authorities concluded or quarantined.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first estimations suggest that the nursing benefit for workers will correspond to an average daily amount of €15.8.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                It is foreseen that in 2020, the nursing benefit will be paid to 200,000 beneficiaries with a total duration of 101 days.
The nursing benefit will be granted for all days during the closure of school and pre-school facilities, not only for 10 calendar days. Expenditure on the basis of these assumptions is expected to be around EUR 319.2 million in 2020
