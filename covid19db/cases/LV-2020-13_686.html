            <p>
                In cooperation with the Ministry of Economics, the state owned development finance institution ALTUM has prepared assistance measures for companies affected by crisis due to spread of Covid-19 epidemic. 
For companies that have experienced objective difficulties in making loan repayments to banks due to the Covid-19 crisis, ALTUM offers a credit guarantee that will allow the bank to defer payment of the principal amount.
ALTUM is a state-owned development finance institution, which offers state aid for various target groups with the help of financial tools (such as loans, credit guarantees, investing in venture capital funds, etc.). ALTUM develops and implements state aid programmes to compensate for the market's shortcomings that can't be solved by private financial institutions.
The law “On Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Threat to the State and Its Consequences Due to the Spread of COVID-19” (adopted on 20 March 2020, valid from 22 March 2020) and Regulations of Cabinet Nr. 122 Regarding the Increase of the Reserve Capital provides funding for the measure. Cabinet Regulation No. 150 Regulations Regarding Guarantees for the Enterprises whose Activity has been Affected by the Spread of COVID-19 (adopted on 19 March 2020) regulates the measure.

            <p>
                Credit guarantee is available to businesses, farmers, and those working in the fisheries and aquaculture industries regardless their size. The amount of the financial service covered by the guarantee shall not exceed 25% of the business’ total turnover in 2019, but the maximum amount of the guarantee shall not exceed EUR 5 million. The guarantee covers up to 50% of the amount of the financial service (at the moment the guarantee is granted). Term of the guarantee is up to 6 years for financial leasing and investment loans, and up to 3 years for working capital financial services. Guarantee premium is 0.5% per year.
