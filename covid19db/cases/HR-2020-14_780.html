            <p>
                Regardless of the current circumstances in Croatia and across the world as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hold the economy in its firm grip, the Adris Group's management board decided that there would be no layoffs within that company. The Adris Group will realize already contracted and ongoing investments, and they will continue to prepare for planned projects.Aware of the circumstances and the unknown situation when it comes to the potential duration of the coronavirus crisis - and despite the exceptionally good business results it achieved in 2019 when net profit after minority interests was 31 percent higher than it was in 2018, the company's management have agreed to cut their salaries by 30 percent over the next three + three months that will be used primarily for improving the solvency of the company and as possibility to reduce the costs.
