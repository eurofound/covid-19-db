            <p>
                Teleworking arrangements and/or work from home arrangements are among the measures taken by the Republic of Cyprus to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19. The provision has been issued with the Decree 101 of the Quarantine Law, Chapter 260 of the Minister of Health. It addresses employees in the public and the broader public sector and employees in the Educational Service of Cyprus. The provision authorizes Ministers and Deputy Ministers as well as the Heads of Independent authorities/ bureaus / offices to define the needs of their departments and schedule their activities accordingly.     * On Wednesday 8 April, the President of the Republic announced the decision of the Cabinet to extent all the measures taken by the Decrees of the Minister of Health up until 30 April 2020. The Minister of Health undertakes, currently, a legal and technical processing of these measures.

                The services of the public and broader public sector operate for this period of time with minimum personnel and for emergency issues only. All other personnel, and where possible, works from home. Essential services of the Republic, i.e. hospitals and the arm forces, are excluded from the regulation. The Minister of Education, in addition, is authorized to issue an educational programme for the period that the operation of public schools is suspended and make use of technologies to cover part of the school curricula. The regulation also provides that public servants, not in appointed service or in teleworking, are obligated to provide services in other domains if needed.
