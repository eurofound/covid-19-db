            </h2>
            <p>
                The government action that closed school institutions at all levels subsequently required also the amendment of the definition of care allowance in the Czech Sickness Insurance Act.In an extraordinary bill the government has decided to modify the period of validity for payment of the care allowance to support the parents of young schoolchildren who are homeschooling their children. Parents will be entitled to care allowance as long as the ban on school attendance remains in force.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The current phrasing of the Sickness Insurance Act provides care allowance for a period of nine calendar days to parents of children under the age of 10 who cannot be put in the care of a school / child-care facility; for single parents the care allowance is for a period of sixteen calendar days. Due to COVID-19 the Czech government decided to raise the age limit for these children from 10 to 13 years of age and parents will be entitled to care allowance as long as the ban on school attendance remains. Those taking care of the disabled members of the family at home following the closure of day care centres are also to be entitled to the care allowance. Also the self-employed are entitled to apply for the money. The government has approved a financial contribution for the self-employed who are currently at home to ensure childcare. The state will pay 424 (€15,41) crowns per day, i.e. just under 14,000 (€510) crowns per month, to all self-employed persons taking care of children aged 6 to 13, on condition that a second member of the family no longer receives the care allowance.Applications are collected on-line.
