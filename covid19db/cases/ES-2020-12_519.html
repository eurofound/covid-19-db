            </h2>
            <p>
                The measure is aimed at providing income protection for self-employed workers and freelancers. More specifically, this measure makes more flexible the access to benefits in case of cessation of activity for self-employed workers in case of financial difficulty. The measure is part of the Royal Decree 8/2020.The cessation of activity benefit already existed. What changes under the new regulation is that the requirements are relaxed and times change: it will be charged for a period of one month (or until the state of alarm ends). Exceptionally, people who have seen their businesses closed and activities suspended may collect the cessation of activity benefit (unemployment of the self-employed).

                Exceptionally and with validity until the last day of the month in which the state of alarm declared by Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14, ends, will be entitled to an extraordinary benefit for cessation of activity:a) Self-employed workers included in the Special Scheme for Self-Employed Workers, the self-employed agricultural workers included in the Special System for Agricultural Own-account Workers and the self-employed workers included in the Special Scheme for Sea Workers whose activities are suspended.b) Self-employed workers included in the Special Scheme for Self-Employed Workers, the self-employed agricultural workers included in the Special System for Self-Employed Agricultural Workers and the self-employed workers included in the Special Scheme for Sea Workers who, without ceasing their activity, their monthly income prior to which the benefit is requested is reduced by at least 75 percent in relation to the average billing for the previous calendar semester, provided they are not in some of the cases included in the letters c) and d) below.c) Self-employed agricultural workers of seasonal productions included in the Special System for Self-Employed Agricultural Workers, as well as fishing productions, shellfish or of specific seasonal products included in the Special Scheme for Sea Workers, when their average turnover in the months of the production campaign prior to the one requested for the benefit is reduced, at least, by 75 percent in relation to the same months of the campaign of the previous year.d) Self-employed workers who carry out activities in any of the following CNAE 2009 codes: 5912, 5915, 5916, 5920 and between 9001 and 9004, both included, provided that, without ceasing their activity, their turnover in the month natural prior to which the benefit is requested is reduced by at least 75 percent in relation to that made in the previous 12 months.
