            </h2>
            <p>
                The scheme addresses the vulnerable working groups holding a certificate from their personal doctors or Ministry of Health according to the Decree 127 of the Quarantine Law, Chapter 260 of the Minister of Health.  The scheme aims to protect workers having particular health issues allowing their absence from work in order to protect themselves and the deterioration of the health condition. The Ministry of Health prepared a list with the group of workers considered as vulnerable. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Scheme grants the special sick leave allowance to the vulnerable groups subjected to the virus including: a. persons who are listed as vulnerable as designated by the Ministry of Health, b. persons subjected to compulsory isolation and self-isolation, where the nature of their work does not permit teleworking, c. persons affected with the COVID 19 holding a certificate from the Ministry of Health and d. persons aged 63-65 years who do not receive a statutory pension and fall under a, b and c categories holding the corresponding certificate.The special sick leave is calculated at 60% of the value of the insurance units for employees and self-employed workers qualified under the Social Insurance Law. The maximum amount that would be paid as a special sick leave may not exceed 1,214 euros.  On the 23 April 2020, the Cabinet amended the calculation of the payable amount to the beneficiaries in order to support as many employees as possible currently out of work or full-time work. For the purpose of paying the Special Sick Leave Benefit, the insurable earnings of the year 2018 will be taken into account, but in addition, a comparison will be made based on the declared salary of January 2020. The payable amount will be the highest amount that results from this comparison taking into account the 60% for both calculations.  Additionally, a minimum payable amount of 356 euros has been defined for beneficiaries, which amount is equal to the lowest statutory pension. An additional amendment to the Scheme is the inclusion of persons over 65 years of age who do not receive statutory pension and continue to work.
