                Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 (art. 23 and 25) grants 15 days of parental leave to employees of the public and the private sector, workers enrolled in the separate social security fund (Gestione separata), and self-employed workers with children under 12 years of age. Alternative, parents can require a lump sum of €600 for baby-sitting. This measure aims at allowing parents to take care of children after the suspension of educational services and the closure of schools. Moreover, Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 (art. 24) granted workers assisting disabled people under the Law 104/1992 12 additional days of paid monthly leave for the months of March and April.

            <p>
                For the year 2020 starting from March 5, as a consequence of the suspension of educational services for children and the closure of schools, workers with children below the age of 12 (no age limits for disabled workers) are entitled to 15 days of parental leave.This entitlement is granted to employees of the private and the public sector, workers enrolled in the separate social security fund of the National Social Security Institute (Gestione separata INPS), and self-employed workers with a social security position. An allowance, amounting to 50% of the remuneration for employees and 50% of the usual remuneration for self-employed workers with children under 12 years of age, is foreseen.The use of the parental leave is foreseen to alternate between both parents, for a total of fifteen days, and is subject to the condition that in the family there is no other parent who is a beneficiary of income support tools in case of suspension or cessation of work or another unemployed or non-working parent.As an alternative to parental leave, working parents are entitled to a lump sum of €600 for babysitting activities. This amount is increased to €1,000 for doctors, nurses or other workers in the public or private health sector.In addition to the above mentioned parental leave, parents of children aged 12 to 16 have the right to abstain from work for the period of suspension of educational activities without remuneration. The Decree Law also increased the number of days of paid monthly leave for workers assisting disabled people under the Law 104/1992 by 12 additional days for the months of March and April.
