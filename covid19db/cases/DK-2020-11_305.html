            <p>
                In order to avoid direct dismissals, the government has made it possible for the companies to make use of the existing jobsharing scheme in a more flexible way. Jobsharing is covered by collective agreement. The flexible measures was passed by a so-called urgent statute in the Parliament. According to the statute, a rule about notifying the local jobcentre a week before jobsharing can begin is abolished because it might create unnecessary red tape for the company.

            <p>
                According to the collective agreement a company can introduce a period of 13 weeks of jobsharing in the company as a provisional measure. Normally, the company must notify the local jobcentre a week before the jobsharing can start. This rule is abolished with the aim that the company can start jobsharing the same day the notification is send.  At the same time, it becomes possible for companies to switch between the types of jobsharing periods when a cycle of jobsharing is completed. As it is, the working hours must be reduced by at least 2 full days per day. week or with 1 week of full-time work followed by 1 week of unemployment. However, the distribution can also be arranged with 2 weeks of full-time work followed by 1 week of unemployment or with 2 weeks of full-time work followed by 2 weeks of unemployment. According to the urgent statute, the employer can switch between the periods when the one in use expires. During the periods of unemployment, the employees in question will receive a supplementary unemployment benefit.
