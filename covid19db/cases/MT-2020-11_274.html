            <p>
                Due to COVID-19 certain groups of individuals considered at greater risk were advised not to go to work and to work from home where possible. Individuals with disability were considered to be at greater risk to COVID-19 than other groups of individuals. A benefit was created for individuals with disability who were employed in the private sector, who due to COVID-19 were advised not to go to work on medical grounds, but were also unable to work from home. To be eligible, individuals had to be advised not to go to work on medical grounds after the 8th of March 2020.

                In view of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact upon business, and following consultation with social partners, the government initially announced a package of measures which included the deferral of taxes and financial support to incentivise telework. Following this announcement, employer associations publicly announced that these were insufficient and would not protect their businesses or jobs, stating the government instead needed to subsidise wages. These calls continued when on the 18th March, the government announced futher measures including support for those who had lost their job, the disabled (including this measure), and for employers to subsidise quarantine leave. On the 24th of March, the government announced a third package of measures which included support for wages and other measures previously announced. This third package of measures was announced by the government whilst flanked by union and employer association members. It was announced that this package was the result of tripartite consultation. Furthermore, following announcement of these futher measures, employer associations announced their satisfaction with the package.
