                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                In march 2020 the Government introduced some measures to provide income support also to those workers - partially or totally prevented from work in reason of the COVID-19 outbreak - that were anyway not covered by the main instruments sustaining the majority of the Italian workforce.The Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020, Article 27, introduces an income support measure of €600 for the month of March for professionals, workers in continuous and coordinated collaboration agreement, self-employed, seasonal workers and workers of the entertainment industry. The benefit will be paid directly from the National Social Security Institute (INPS) and aims at supporting income of those workers which are not eligible for other income support measures such as the different wage guarantee funds.Always through the Decree Law No. 18/2020, Article 44, the Government allocates further €300 million for income support of professionals registered to private social security agencies and self-employed and employees not covered by any other analogous measure.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                A one lump sum of € 600 was awarded for the month of March to different groups of workers by Decree-Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 in order to support their income. The categories included are: ● Professionals with a VAT number active on 23 February 2020 and workers with coordinated and continuous collaboration relationships.● Self-employed registered to the dedicated mandatory social insurance schemes (Assicurazione Generale Obbligatoria, AGO).● Seasonal workers in the tourism sector and in thermal establishments that involuntarily ended their employment in the period between 1 January 2020 and 17 March 2020, who are not employed and do not receive a pension.● Fixed-term agricultural workers, who do not receive a pension and have worked at least 50 days in agriculture in 2019.● Workers enrolled in the pension fund for workers in the entertainment industry (Fondo pensioni Lavoratori dello spettacolo), with at least 30 daily contributions paid in the year 2019 to the same fund, with an income of no more than €50,000, and who do not receive a pension. The total amount of resources allocated for this measure is about €200 million.The second and additional fund for income support of professionals registered to private social security agencies and self-employed and employees not covered by another analogous measure, has been increased, from €300 million to €500 million, with the Decree No. 53073 of 27 April 2020 issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).A further joint Decree issued by the MEF and the Ministry of Labour on 30 April 2020 specified that are covered by this second measure also:● Seasonal workers not covered by other measures that involuntarily ended their employment between the 1 January 2019 and 31 January 2020 and that in the same period worked at least for 30 days.● Workers on call that worked for at least 30 days in the period 1st January 2019 and 31 January 2020.● Occasional workers not registered as self employed, and checked in the respective section of the National Social Security Agency on 23 February 2020, that obtained at least one monthly contribution between 1 January 2019 and 23 February 2020 and that are unemployed from the 23 February 2020. ● Door-to-door sales persons registered as self-employed before 24 February 2020 and with an annual income from this activity, for 2019, higher than €5,000.

                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Almost 5 million people are estimated to be eligible to this measure. As to 8 April 2020, 3.65 million requests were placed online to National Institute of Social Security (INPS).The funds allocated by the Government for the support of professionals registered to private social security agencies (initially about €200 million on the overall amount of €300 million) was used up at a very fast pace, and compelled the government to allocate further €80 million to solve the issue.
