            </h2>
            <p>
                Royal Decree Law 7/2020 establishes measures addressing anticipation and extension of reductions in social security contributions paid by companies related to the tourism sector in order to keep seasonal workers (with discontinous open-ended employment contracts) in employment during periods of lower activity.In February 2020 there were 360,000 of discontinous open-ended employment contracts mostly directly or indirectly linked to the tourism sector (along with workers in the agriculture and the food industry, not covered by this sectoral measure).
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Royal Decree Law 7/2020 of 12 March establishes that companies related to the tourism sector are allowed to reduce the payment to the social security for the discontinous open-ended (seasonal) employment contracts by 50%, as long as they keep these employees during the months from February to June.These bonuses may be applied to all types of contingences for which companies pay contributions (unemployment, vocational training, common contingences).Concerning the scope of the measure, only companies engaged in the tourism sector are allowed to these rebates, as well as to those in the commerce and hotel industry. The rebates are nationally applied except in Balearic and Canary Islands during the months of February and March 2020, since other mitigation measures were adopted in 2019 to alleviate the effects of the opening of insolvency proceedings of the Thomas Cook business group. Later in April 2020, the government has adopted a new measure addressing these types of special employment contracts mainly used in the tourism sector. These employees may access unemployment benefits in the context of ERTEs - temporary employment reduction schemes -, as when the COVID-19 crisis broke out, many of these workers had not taken up their posts. With this measure, they may have a 90-day benefit even if they have consumed their unemployment right or have not contributed enough time to be entitled to.
