            <p>
                Initially, the allowance for idle time was granted only to employees. On March 31, the government supported the proposal of the Ministry of Culture and expanded the normative regulation also to self-employed, those who receive authors’ fees, and the micro-entrepreneurs.  The allowance for idle time measure in general is described in Section 14 of the law “On Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Threat to the State and Its Consequences Due to the Spread of COVID-19” (adopted on 20 March 2020, valid from 22 March 2020).Specifically regarding the self-employed, the government has adopted the Regulations of Cabinet of Ministers No. 179, "Regulations regarding the Allowance for Idle Time for self-employed who are affected by spread of Covid-19" (Adopted on 31 March 2020).

            <p>
                The eligible self-employed are individuals registered in the State Revenue Service as involved in economic activity, that have paid social contributions as self-employed, or as receiver of author’s fee, or have paid micro-enterprise tax, or have paid taxes as individual merchants, and have not got income during the idle period, except some permanent authors’ fees.The allowance is calculated using the State Revenue Service data that is provided in the declarations of self-employed, according to the following criteria:- for those who pay micro-enterprise tax, 50% of average monthly income from the economic activity as micro-entrepreneur (reference period is last two full quarters);- self-employed person in general tax regime – 75% of the average income (the reference period is the two last full quarters, income is calculated in accordance with the state mandatory social insurance contribution of a person);- for a person from both above mentioned categories who within the idle time has returned to work after child care leave – 100% of granted parents benefit (the reference period is of six months before declaring the state of emergency).For neither of categories the allowance can be more than EUR 700.The regulations define 17 reasons when the allowance can be rejected.
