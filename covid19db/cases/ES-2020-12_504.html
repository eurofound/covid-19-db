            <p>
                This measure allows workers to adapt or reduce their workday to care for their dependents, with a 100% reduction in the workday being possible. The objective is to facilitate those persons with care responsibilities, including disabled, elderly or child, to adapt their working time and eventually reduce it in order to be able to guarantee the care tasks. This policy was included in Royal Decree 8/2020 of 17th March. Those employees eligible will contact their company that will apply the regulations contained in the Labour Code in relation to reduction of working time.

Likewise, exceptional circumstances will be considered to exist when there are decisions taken by the governmental authorities related to COVID-19 that imply the closure of educational centers or of any other nature that dispense care or attention to the person in need of them. Exceptional circumstances that require the presence of the employee will also be considered to be present, when the person who until now had been in charge of the direct care or assistance of the working person's spouse or family member up to the second degree could not continue to do so for related justified causes. with COVID-19.
