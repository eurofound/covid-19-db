            </h2>
            <p>
                The Covid-19 pandemic has made it necessary to close schools and kindergartens across the country. Parents who are entitled to care benefit can receive care money to stay home with children during the closure. The difficult situation can increase the need to care, hence the number of care days a parent can receive care benefit is temporarily doubled for the calendar year 2020. Increased use of care benefit in the current situation can have major financial consequences for employers and the Norwegian business community. To reduce the burden on employers, the employer’s responsibility to pay for care benefit is reduced to 3 days, and the employer can seek reimbursement from The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration for pay from the fourth day.
            </p>

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Employees are usually entitled to care benefit , also called "sick-child-days", when they need to be absent from work if a child, or the person who usually looks after the child, is ill. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of days a parent is entitled to is doubled from 10 to 20 days per calendar year when you have one or two children under the age of 12 and from 15 to 30 days per calendar year when you have more than two children under the age of 12. The employer’s responsibility for paying the care benefit days is reduced to 3 days (regularly 10 days). The employer also offsets other days of care allowance, but may seek a refund from the Labor and Welfare Administration from the fourth day. Self-employed workers and freelancers are entitled to care benefit from The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration from the 4th day of absence (regularly from the 11th day of absence).
