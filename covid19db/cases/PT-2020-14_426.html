                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                The organisations of the social and solidary sector have traditionally been  key partners of the state in the provision of services of general interest to the populations and in the satisfaction of collective needs. These organisations are particularly exposed to the effects of the pandemic, which generates unbearable situations of overload.Therefore, the Order 82-C/2020 of 28 March 2020 provides for a temporary and exceptional measure to support the emergency reinforcement of health and social care facilities, in order to ensure the capacity of response of the public and solidary institutions operating in the health and social area, during the pandemic of COVID-19.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                This Order creates a suppport measure regarding the emergency reinforcement of health and social care facilities, in order to ensure the capacity of response of the public and solidary institutions operating in the health and social area, during the pandemic of COVID-19.It also introduces an extraordinary regime increasing the monthly grant of «Contrato emprego-inserção» (CEI) and «Contrato emprego-inserção+» (CEI+) in projects developed in these institutions, with the duration of three months.Eligibility criteria:1. Public bodies or private non-profit organisations operating in the social and health area, such as health services, hospitals, residential care or home care for elderly or persons with a disability or incapacity may be promoters of the measure.2. Projects associated with situations of overload in the organisations due to the pandemic, namely derived from the increase in the activities or to the temporary impediment of their workers due to illness, prophylactic isolation or care for relatives or dependents.These projects are framed within the concept of socially useful work. They have one month duration, that may be extended up to three months.The recipients of the measure may be persons who are not aged over 60 and do not deserve specific protection belonging to the following groups: unemployed receiving unemployment benefit; unemployed receiving minimum income; other unemployed; workers whose employment contract was suspended or with a reduced working time; part-time workers; students, particularly in higher education, and trainees, preferentially in relevant domains, aged 18 or over.The promoters ensure food, transportation (or transportation allowance), accidents at work insurance and personal protective equipment to the recipients. They also ensure payment of a grant, co-funded in 90% by the Institute of Employment and Vocational Training (Instituto do Emprego e Formação Profissional, I.P. - IEFP, I.P.).The unemployed receiving unemployment benefit are entitled to a complementary monthly grant equal to the social support index (Indexante de Apoios Sociais - IAS) (€438,81 in 2020). The other recipients are entitled to a monthly grant equal to 1.5 times the IAS.The increase in the monthly grant of «Contrato emprego-inserção» (CEI) and «Contrato emprego-inserção+» (CEI+) is equal to 0.8 times the IAS for the unemployed receiving unemployment benefit and to 0.5 times the IAS for the remaining participants. This increase is fully paid by IEFP, I.P.
