            </h2>
            <p>
                The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced by the British government on 20 March 2020 in the context of more stringent lock-down measures which entered into force on 23 March 2020. The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees’ (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to 2,820 Euros (£2,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.Employers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.
            </p>

                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The scheme has been critizised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures). The scheme is set to be up and runnning by the end of April 2020 with the possibility of claiming payments in arrears.
