                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                COVID-19 had a substantial impact upon the Maltese economy. The government rolled out several initiatives to save jobs, but it was clear early on that unemployment was rising. In view of this, an additional unemployment benefit for individuals who due to the impact of COVID-19 lost their job in the private sector after the 8th March 2020 was introduced. This will be received in conjunction with the Contributory Unemployment Benefit. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                This will be received by individuals who were working full-time or part-time in the private sector before becoming unemployed after the 8th March 2020. Additionally, individuals must be registering for work under Part 1 with Jobsplus (that national employment and training agency).
            </p>
            <p>
                Such individuals who would qualify for the 'Contributory Unemployment Benefit' would also be eligible for this additional benefit. Between the two, individuals will receive a direct payment of €166.15 a week for those who were working full time, or €103.85 for those who were working part-time before they became unemployed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, their Social Security Contribution will be paid, and their future contributory pension rights safeguarded. Children's allowance will continue to be received and increased to the maximum rate of €24.08 per week per child (depending on previous income, individuals may already have been in the maximum children's allowance bracket). Other benefits that the person may have been entitled to such as the 'In Work Benefit' and 'Supplementary Allowance' will also continue to be received. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Use of measure

            <p>
                In March 2020, unemployment increased by just over 300 individuals. The number of individuals who made use of this measure however was not released.

                In view of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact upon business, and following consultation with social partners, the government initially announced a package of measures which included the deferral of taxes and financial support to incentivise telework. Following this announcement, employer associations publicly announced that these were insufficient and would not protect their businesses or jobs, stating the government instead needed to subsidise wages. These calls continued when on the 18th March, the government announced futher measures including support for those who had lost their job (this measure), the disabled, and for employers to subsidise quarantine leave. On the 24th of March, the government announced a third package of measures which included support for wages and other measures previously announced. This third package of measures was announced by the government whilst flanked by union and employer association members. It was announced that this package was the result of tripartite consultation. Furthermore, following announcement of these futher measures, employer associations announced their satisfaction with the package.
