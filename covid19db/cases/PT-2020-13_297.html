            <p>
                This exceptional and temporary measure, set by Decree-Law No. 10-G / 2020 of 26 March 2020, simplifies the operationalisation and sets new conditions to the temporary measure provided for in the Ordinance No. 71-A / 2020 of 15 March to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced exceptional changes to the ‘Lay-off’ regime defined by Labour Code (Law No. 7/2009). The measure aims at protecting jobs and maintaining labour contracts in companies by supporting 2/3 of workers’ wages. This measure adds the following main provisions: it forbids the companies that are entitled to the support to eliminate jobs (collective and individual redundancies); and establishes that the state budget will cover the financing of the part of wages provided by social security

            <p>
                Decree-Law No. 10-G / 2020 of 26 March 2020 establishes that companies in a crisis situation as a result of: i) a complete halt in the activity or ii) or abrupt and sharp decrease of activity of at least 40% of invoicing have access to extraordinary support to help pay the wages of their workers for a maximum period of 6 months. While with the provisions set by Ordinance No. 71-A / 2020 of 15 March it was necessary to prove an abrupt and sharp drop in invoicing, quantified at least at 40 percent, with reference to the same three-month period (2019); the Decree-Law No. 10-G / 2020 of 26 March 2020 simplified the process insofar it is enough to demonstrate this break in the thirty days prior to the date of the order, with reference to the monthly average of the two months prior to that period.  During the reduction or suspension of activity period, as well as in the 60 days following the application of the extraordinary support, the employer cannot fire the workers encompassed by these measures on the grounds of collective dismissals or individual dismissals with basis on job extinction (article 13). The financial support - (as provided for in paragraph 4 of article 305 of the Labor Code) - corresponds to an amount equal to 2/3 of the gross remuneration up to a maximum of 3 minimum wages (€ 1905), 70% of which is guaranteed by Security Social and 30% guaranteed by the employer, with a duration of one month, which can be extended monthly, up to a maximum of 6 months.The amount guaranteed by social security is financed by the State Budget; and the support provided is eligible for EU financing (article 16).
