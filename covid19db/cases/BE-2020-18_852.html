                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                Domestic personnel of private households can be employed and payed via so called service vouchers (dienstencheque), a form of payment that is partially subsidized by the government. The service voucher sector and its employees are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the Corona crisis. The nature of their jobs makes it difficult to maintain distance from their clients (who are probably at home due to the quasi lockdown). The remuneration in the sector is fairly low in general. If employees have to make use of temporary unemployment, which is a percentage of their wage, this could lead to financial problems for the employees.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Walloon government has planned to increase the hourly allowance from 1 to 31 May in certain cases. For hours without services provided: all companies can claim an aid of €18 per hour per worker not benefiting from temporary unemployment (all requests will be processed on the basis of €18 instead of €14).
            </p>
            <p>
                For hours with services provided: only companies with a maximum of 250 workers under a service voucher contract (declared to Sodexo during the first quarter of 2020) will be able to benefit from the reimbursement amounting up to €27 instead of €23.86 .
This reimbursement value applies for services which took place in the month of May.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brussels has also implemented some additional support measures specifically for the service voucher sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                The automatic granting of flat-rate aid in the form of a lump sum of €4,000 to recognised service voucher companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                On condition that they submit an application: the possibility for service voucher companies to financially support their employees who were placed in temporary unemployment as a result of Covid-19 measures. In particular, an additional €2.50 gross per declared hour of temporary unemployment
            </p>
            <p>
                Temporary increase of the amount of the regional intervention by €2 per service voucher offered at the issuing company for reimbursement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flanders: From 16 March to 19 April, the regional contribution will be increased by €8.64. This means €23 instead of €14.36 per voucher. This increase in payment for the service voucher companies has to make up for the additional costs they have to provide protective materials for their personnel.
            </p>

                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                For Wallonia the total amount is currently unknown, as the uptake is up the individual company and workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Brussels 3 of the 4 measures are applied automatically by data is currently unavailable about the uptake. Uptake on the measure that requires application is unknown as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Flanders the measure applies to all service coucher companies.
