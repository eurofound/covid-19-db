            <p>
                After the Government declared a state of emergency and quarantine, many self-employed people had to terminate or partially restrict their activities. On 7 April 2020, the Law No. XIII-2846 amending Articles 5-1, 13, 24, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 49 and 50 of Law on Employment of the Republic of Lithuania (No. XII-2470) came into force, providing for assistance to those self-employed persons that during the quarantine period were forced to terminate their activities due to the state of emergency. Self-employed people shall apply for a flat-rate benefit to the Employment Service.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                A fixed benefit of €257/month may be granted to self-employed persons who have been forced to cease their activity due to the emergency situation. The benefit will be paid if a self-employed person meets all of the conditions below:• Self-employment has been registered for at least three months in the last year and has not been deregistered until the date the Government declared the state of emergency and quarantine;• During the state of emergency and quarantine declared by the Government, a person does not work under an employment contract and does not have a legal relationship equivalent to employment relationships;• The person has no outstanding debts to the state budget and in relation to social insurance payments to the state agency 'Sodra' (or the debt has been rescheduled and is not an impediment);• The person does not have the status of a legal person in liquidation or bankruptcy.Benefits paid for an incomplete month will be proportionately lower. Payment of the benefit to a self-employed person would be terminated when the Government revokes the emergency or quarantine, or the person no longer meets at least one of the conditions above.
