            <p>
                This measure was introduced by the government, specifically, via the Ministry of Economics and Climate. This is part of the package of national measures taken to mitigate effects of COVID-19.It should be noted that as of April 2020, Parliament and First Chamber have agreed to the package of bills, though in this situation the cabinet did not need to formally wait for agreement in order to enact the measures.  It has been introduced as bunch of emergency solutions specifically to combat or cushion the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. The measure is for 3 months, but there is budget available to extend it for other 3 months. More specifically this measure is aimed at providing the enterprise with budget to pay their costs. The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) till the pandemic is under control.

            <p>
                The subsidy for enterprises in affected sectors, or Tegemoetkoming Ondernemers Getroffen Sectoren (TOGS) is a government allowance for enterprises that are directly negatively affected by the government’s COVID-19 measures. These enterprises are eligible to receive a one-time government subsidy of €4,000, and in general consist of businesses that are directly, negatively affected by the government’s measures. This includes enterprises that were forced to close doors or could not operate fully because of the government’s corona measures.The main selection criteria is SBI codes, the Dutch equivalent of NACE codes. Currently this includes more sectors and sub-sectors than can be noted down here. The sectors included is adapted regularly, by the Ministry since also enterprises that were not obliged to close doors were hit hard such as small fashion shop, so these enterprises were included at a later stage and the ministry announced that the list is not complete yet (13 April 2020). Indeed, this list seems to be evolving and expanding as the crisis continues and future prognoses start to be developed.

                (Though not discussed in great detail, the social partners (national level trade unions and employer organisations), have come together to discuss with the government how best to tackle the effects of the corona virus on workers and employers so as to keep the Dutch economy going. In the Netherlands relevant, national sectoral social partners are often involved in national policy making in a consultational capacity so that partners may reflect on regulatory plans and their intended impacts. This happens in a direct consultation fashion or through tripartite meetings (facilitated by the National Labour Foundation). The social partners were consulted for the whole package of measures introduced by the Dutch cabinet on March 17th 2020.)
