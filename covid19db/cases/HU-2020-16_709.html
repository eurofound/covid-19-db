            </h2>
            <p>
                Under government decree 103/2020 employees working in the R+D field as engineers receive an income supplement for three months during the pandemic in order to prevent job cuts in this occupational field. The income supplement is on average 40% of the gross wage and the amount is transferred from the state directly to the employee. The measure aims at preventing job losses in areas of innovation and product development due to covid.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The employee can apply for the subsidy for a duration of three months no later than 30 days after the end of the state of emergency or 31 Dec 2020. The support is for new knowledge, intellectual developments, products, services or procedures and methods. The recipient employee must not receive any other employment subsidy and should be employed in an R+D position. The employer must have operated for at least 6 months and prove that the request is in connection with the economic hardship suffered due to covid-19, together with steps taken to overcome the situation. They must agree to keep headcount level with that of a month before and to keep the employee on for at least 3 months after the subsidy ceases, with no salary cuts. The employer cannot be under insolvency procedures. The subsidy does not apply to work carried out at a new location compared with pre-covid (including in home office).The income supplement paid by the state is 40% of gross income, but no more than HUF 318,920 (€911) per month. The maximum support applies to gross monthly salaries of HUF 670,000 (€1,888) with all usual taxes payable.

            <h2>
                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The measure is typically useful for multinational companies in manufacturing sectors, but it is not sector-specific. There is no information on the number of possible applicants, and due to the complexity of the criteria, for example defining what qualifies as an "R+D activity", the processing of applications is not expected to be seamless.
