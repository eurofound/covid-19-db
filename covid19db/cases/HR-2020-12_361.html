                        Tourism is very sensitive to safety and health because if tourists do not feel safe, they do not travel. Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month.

                    <p>
                        However, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.

                        The support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by coronavirus is implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by awarding grants as a form of co-financing of wage costs. The Croatian Employment Service (CES) awards grants to an eligible employer in the amount of HRK 3.250,00 (€434) per month for full-time worker and HRK 1.625,00 (€217) per month for part-time worker. CES also awards a proportional part of the amount of HRK 3,250.00 or HRK 1,625.00 per worker for the time they did not work according to the decision of the Civil Protection Directorate.

                                        The government announced on 20 October 2020, its intention is to change the conditions for assistance to the companies having problems due to COVID-19. The graded assistance will depend on a downturn in the volume of business. Thus, businesses with at least a 40% fall in their activity will be eligible to use monthly grants of HRK 2,000 (€266.66) per employee. Those businesses with a 50% fall in their turnover can count on monthly grants of HRK 2,500 (€333.33) per employee. Those employers experiencing a slump of up to 55% in their business activity can be awarded HRK 3,000 (€400) per employee per month, whereas HRK 3,500 (€466.66) is designed for a slump of up to 60%, and the highest monthly grant per employee is the amount of HRK 4,000 (€533.33)  is to be given to businesses with a slump of more than 60% in their business activities. Also, those employers are exempt from paying contributions in relation to those grants. The fall in business activity will be compared to the volume of business in the second and third quarters of 2019, so as to get a more realistic picture. Some businesses in the hospitality sector will be able to choose whether to compare the current state of affairs on a monthly basis or in relation to the quarters year-on-year. The new set is applicable as of 1 October 2020 and will be on force until the end of the year. The government underscored that to date, the government had disbursed HRK 6.85 billion (€912 million) for the job-retention scheme and that this amount will have risen above HRK 7.2 billion (€960 million) by the end of this year. The latest set has been hammered out following consultations with social partners, employers and trade unions.

The measure is directed towards following sectors: transport and storage - primarily passenger transport by land; accommodation and food and beverage service activities; travel agencies, tour operators and other reservation services and related activities; creative, artistic and entertainment activities, entertainment and recreation activities and production and showing of films and video films; recording and distribution of sound recordings and distribution of music recordings. 
Eligible employers are organizers of cultural, business and sporting events, organizers of fairs and weddings, and related activities such as equipment rental companies, audio and video recording, ticket sales, hall rental and other companies that generate most of their income from events and public gatherings. Therefore, eligible employers are commercial companies, crafts, family farms and natural persons who are self-employed and who are insured on that basis.
Eligible employees are those employed by employers from the target group of employers: all insured persons with the employer in question (regardless of whether the employment is a fixed-term or indefinite, whether they are citizens of Croatia, EU or third countries, full-time or part-time or have some status such as a single parent, a Croatian war veteran and a posted worker) and workers employed in representative offices. 
The monthly amount of the support is HRK 4,000 (€533) per full-time employee, with the proportional part per employee according to the number of hours of part-time work and HRK 250 (€33) contribution for pension insurance based on mandatory individual capitalized saving (fully funded). 
Employers need to prove that in June 2020 they had a decrease in turnover/revenue at least 60% compared to June 2019, based on the submission of the VAT form for June 2020 and June 2019 to the Tax Administration to receive support for July, and a 60% drop in July to receive support for August. Quarterly VAT payers have to prove a decrease in turnover/revenue of 60% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019. If the employer operates for less than 12 months, it is necessary for him or her to prove a decrease in turnover/revenue by at least 60% in June 2020 compared to February 2020 based on the submission of the VAT form for June and February 2020.

                                        At the session held on 29 May 2020, the Management Board of the Croatian Employment Service (CES) introduced the Job Preservation Support (COVID-19) for June 2020, which continues the job preservation support for eligible sectors whose business cannot be opened for objective reasons or have a decline of at least 50%, and caused by the COVID-19 crisis, which seeks to avoid the dismissal of workers from the activities actually affected and the sudden entry of workers into the unemployment register.

                                        The amount of the subsidy is HRK 4,000 for the month of June per full-time worker, i.e. the proportional part per worker according to the number of part-time working hours.

                                        Employers need to prove that in May 2020 they had a decrease in income by at least 50% compared to May 2019, based on the submission of the VAT form for May 2020 and May 2019 and that they  are registered in the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute system by 29 February 2020. If the employer operates for less than 12 months, it is necessary to prove a decrease in turnover by at least 50% in May 2020 compared to February 2020 based on the submission of the VAT form for May and February 2020.
                                    </p>

                                        However, CES has changed the conditions and methods of using funds for the implementation of active employment policy measures in 2020, and the most significant change is that the employer will have to repay support if it pays a dividend or profit share by the end of 2021.

                                        This measure should cover up to 100,000 employees, or about 450,000 less than before. The calculations show, that it should be significantly cheaper for the state treasury, given that in June, as estimated in government circles, it would cost around HRK 400 million (€53 million).

                        At the end of March,  around 65,000 employers with around 400,000 thousand workers were registered as users of the scheme at the CES.  At the end of April, the government has paid more than one and a half billion HRK (€200 million) to preserve jobs for around 485,000 employees. Almost 84,000 employers have received support, including 145 large entrepreneurs.
The main criterion for assistance was a 20 percent drop in turnover. Leading recipients of the grants are big touristic company Valamar Riviera with more than 2,500 employees who have been paid more than eight million HRK (€1.07 million) followed by Boxmark Leather with more than 2,000 employees, Mlinar with 1,737 employees, a car parts manufacturer from Solin AD Plastik with more than 1,500 employees. Of all beneficiaries of the grant 91,78% are micro firms with less than 10 employees, 6,99% are SME with less than 50 employees, 1.06% are medium employers with less than 250 employees, 0.03% are bigger employers with more than 250 employees.
                        <br />
                        
According to the data of the Ministry of Labour and Pension System issued in May, the measures included about 550,000 employees. According to the same source, in March and April 2020 alone, the state allocated a total of around HRK 3.5 billion (€467 million) to measures to preserve jobs in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It is estimated that the measures in May 2020 costed the state treasury about HRK two billion (€267 million). Therefore, the state has spent around HRK 5.5 billion (€734 million) in three months of implementing measures to preserve employment in the coronary crisis.
