                        Tourism is very sensitive to safety and health because if tourists do not feel safe, they do not travel. Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.

                        The support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by coronavirus is implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by awarding grants as a form of co-financing of wage costs. The Croatian Employment Service (CES) awards grants to an eligible employer in the amount of HRK 3,250 (€434) per month for full-time worker and HRK 1,625 (€217) per month for part-time worker. CES also awards a proportional part of the amount of HRK 3,250 or HRK 1,625 per worker for the time they did not work according to the decision of the Civil Protection Directorate.

                                        The Governing Board of the Croatian Employment Service (CES) on its meeting on 23 July 2021, extended the support for preservation of the jobs affected by the COVID-19 and the consequences of the earthquakes in the counties Sisak-Moslavina, Zagreb and Karlovac. The measure relates to employers to retain employment of workers whose economic activity was disrupted due to special circumstances. The employers who fulfil the criteria and whose 70% or more workers have confirmation on vaccination against the COVID-19, will be eligible to receive the support in the full amount. The measure is intended for employers in the transport and storage sector, which includes the transport of passengers by land, air and water, as well as air transport of goods. Also are included service activities related to transport as well as the catering and tourism sector - the provision of accommodation and the preparation and serving of food and drink. The measure also applies to administrative and ancillary service activities, which include renting and leasing, travel agencies, tour operators and other related services. Included are also the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which means the production and screening of movies and videos, the recording and publishing of sound and their distribution. The measure applies to organisers of cultural, business and sporting events, such as fairs and weddings, and related activities. Eligible are all employers who have registered their activity by the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute until 28 February 2021, for workers employed by 30 June 2021. The payment of monthly salary costs for July 2021 will be approved for applications received from 26 July to 25 August, if by the end of mentioned period 70% or more of workers for whom he supports are allowed will be inoculated against the COVID-19. In the case that lower percentage of workers will be vaccinated, the support will be proportionally decreased. When applying, the employers will declare under material and criminal liability that the provided data are correct.

All employers who have registered their business activity and recorded their employees in the system of the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute can use the measure for workers employed by 31 May 2021 at the latest. In order to receive support, employers will need to prove that in the period from 1 April, 2020 to 30 September, 2020 they had a decline in revenues in comparison with the same period in 2019 on the basis of submitted VAT forms. Alternatively, employers can prove that in June 2021 they had a decline in revenues in comparison with the same month of 2019. Exceptionally, employers who had established their activity before 1 April 2019, and did not start with their business activities immediately in terms of revenue generation and therefore do not have data for comparison according to these criteria, need to prove that they had a drop in income in the month for which they are seeking support compared to the first complete calendar month of business activity.

                                        Solin-based automotive component maker Ad Plastik is the first Croatian enterprise to publicly announce in 2021 that it is returning its Croatian coronavirus state aid which was received in 2020 year, at a time when it was forced to suspend production due to the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. The management of the company announced that it intends to return the HRK 12.3 million (€1.63 million) in Croatian coronavirus state aid that was used to secure the payment of employee salaries in 2020 year, with an explanation that last year ended with a slightly better result than initially expected. Ad Plastik is holding a general meeting of its shareholders at which one of the points will be the payment of dividends, in which the reason for the return of Croatian coronavirus state aid should also be sought. Namely, one of the conditions for using the aforementioned economic measure is the obligation that the company will not pay out from its operating profit. This condition was mentioned a few months after the virus arrived in Croatia and was a reason as to why many companies quickly changed their minds and decided to return Croatian coronavirus state aid back to the government. Although, as it now seems, the main trigger for the return of the aid was nevertheless the fact that the list of all aid recipients would be made public. According to the data we received from the Croatian Employment Service (CES), so far, 20,850 Croatian enterprises/employers have returned their Croatian coronavirus state aid, and the total amount that sat on that account after its return now stands at almost HRK 206 million (€27.4 million). Since the beginning of the implementation of this measure, a total of HRK 9.395 billion (€1.247 billion) has been paid out to companies to help them preserve jobs, of which HRK 432 million (€57.4 million) was for contributions to those insured in the funded second pension pillar. Croatian coronavirus state aid was paid out to over 111 thousand employers and almost 684 thousand of their employees. The most common reasons for the refund of these benefits, as they have stated from the CES, was the withdrawal of support from their employer, and improperly paid support for sick workers at the expense of the Croatian Health Insurance Institute in the month for which support was received, failure to meet income criteria or other criteria, the non-payment of wages to workers, wrong payments due to multiple requests and so on. Therefore, the CES would not list the payment of profits as the predominant reason for the decision to return the support by the employer. The CES also has noted that voluntary returns mainly took place in the period from June to August 2020, while significant voluntary returns have not been noticed recently. Among the first to return the aid in Croatia was the popular Swedish furniture chain Ikea active in Croatia.

                                        The previous anti-epidemic measures which banned the work of catering and hospitality facilities have being relaxed on 1 March 2021, allowing for the opening of restaurant and coffee shop terraces and the serving of drinks and food outdoors. The representatives of Croatian coffee shop owners said that they simply want to be permitted to work and do not want to be a burden to society in any shape or form. The new working hours for Croatian cafes and restaurants are from 06:00 to 22:00, work can only be performed outdoors on open areas (without the need for Plexiglas and glass). It is necessary to provide a distance of 1.5 meters between each chair and at least 3 meters between each table. The maximum number of people on the terrace at any one time should be displayed at the entrance, and the mandatory placement of disinfectants for customers are some of the conditions. Some coffee shop owners are on the verge of bankruptcy due to their dire financial situation caused by the pandemic. As a mean to support the financial liquidity of restaurants and coffee shops, some towns, like the City of Vinkovci, introduced one-off payment in amount HRK 2,000 (€267) per employee in the restaurants and cafés to overcome the dire financial situation. The owners of restaurants and coffee shops in Vinkovci pay the rent of public spaces in symbolical amount of HRK 1 (€0.13). As a measure to celebrate the opening of objects and invite the guests, in the City of Sibenik, coffee to go was free-of-charge on 1 March 2021 between 12 a.m. and 1 p.m.

Hitherto, a little more than 3,000 entrepreneurs have required the subsidy for payment of fixed costs for electricity, water, internet, rent and the similar. The Tax Administration processed and accepted 65% of the requests, in the amount of HRK 21.5 million (€2,87 million). Compared to December 2020, when the costs for which support was requested had to be previously paid, the novelty is that now entrepreneurs can pay the bills within eight days of the obtaining of the subsidy.

These are employers from Sisak-Moslavina, Zagreb and Karlovac counties, regardless of activity and the level of decline in business activities. Eligible are also employers whose business processes are significantly reduced or restricted due to objective reasons. Objective reasons are: significant damage caused by an earthquake at business or production facilities and/or the inability of workers to come to work. Employers are entitled to support in the amount of HRK 4,000 (€533) per full-time employee, and a proportional part per a part-time employee according to the number of his or her part-time working hours.

                                        On 4 December 2020, the Employment Service published amended conditions for granting support for the preservation of jobs of employers whose business was disrupted due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and for employers covered by decisions of the Civil Protection Headquarters. Among other things, employers are enabled to receive support for November and December 2020 in the event of a decrease in revenues in one month (November 2020 / November 2019 and December 2020 / December 2019). This means the continuation of a monthly allowance of HRK 4,000 (€533) per worker during the lockdown and exemption from payment of social contributions. In addition, the activities eligible for support have been expanded, the right to support market-related undertakings has been introduced and the restriction on board members, directors and procurators regardless of the size of the employer has been lifted. This measure is designed for more than 80,000 private-sector workers. The government had so far preserved 630,000 jobs and helped 107,000 companies by disbursing a total of HRK 7.4 billion (€0.98 billion). As an additional support to employers who are beneficiaries of support from the Employment Service will be available a reimbursement of a part of fixed material costs to entrepreneurs whose work is prohibited or restricted. It will be realised through the Tax Administration.

                                        In measures to support for preservation of jobs in activities affected by COVID-19, employers are given the opportunity that "if there is a termination of the employment contract, business termination or extraordinary dismissal of the employer, he or she does not have to make payment for a worker whose contract has been terminated for a month or days in the month due for payment”. In other words, in such situation, the support to employers is not conditioned by the retention of workers, but their support is only reduced by the number of workers to whom they give a business-related dismissal. Trade Unions state that some employers use the epidemic as an excuse to get rid of workers they want, or those for an indefinite period who will later replace others, with more flexible forms of work, etc. Therefore, on the meeting dedicated to the continuation of measures on 12 October 2020, representatives of the Trade Union in the Governing Board of Croatian Employment Office (a body responsible for designing and implementation of the measures) asked for a ban on business-related dismissal in companies receiving support. The Trade Unions believing that the preservation of jobs with public funds should be conditional on preserving all workers, not just those the employer wants to keep. According to their opinion, this is not an absolute ban on dismissal and reduction of the number of employees, because the expiry of a fixed-term contract, dismissal caused by the employee's behavior, extraordinary dismissal, personal dismissal, dismissal of the employee to the employer and retirement are fully allowed, but economic cancellation should not be allowed.

It is not possible to accumulate the measures; the employer must decide which of the measures is more favourable for him or her. The new eligible sectors, in addition to those previously identified, are: agriculture, forestry, and fishing - only crop and livestock production, hunting and related service industries and fishing, and other service industries - repair of computers and personal and household goods and other personal service industries. The subsidy can be requested for all employees taken on before 30 September 2020. The subsidy amount is determined by the decline in revenue. This must be a decline of at least 60% to qualify for the maximum subsidy of HRK 4,000 (€533) per employee. The employer is obliged to retain all employees – business-related dismissal is not permitted. If an individual employee’s employment contract is terminated for another reason, the employer is entitled to the subsidy payment for the days on which the employee worked until the employment contract was terminated. Payment of funds follows, as before, on the last day of the month for the previous month, and at the latest upon submission of proof that the salary was paid - a VAT form or other legal document. This decision is applied for the period October-December 2020.

                                        The government announced on 20 October 2020, its intention is to change the conditions for assistance to the companies having problems due to COVID-19. The graded assistance will depend on a downturn in the volume of business. Thus, businesses with at least a 40% fall in their activity will be eligible to use monthly grants of HRK 2,000 (€266.66) per employee. Those businesses with a 50% fall in their turnover can count on monthly grants of HRK 2,500 (€333.33) per employee. Those employers experiencing a slump of up to 55% in their business activity can be awarded HRK 3,000 (€400) per employee per month, whereas HRK 3,500 (€466.66) is designed for a slump of up to 60%, and the highest monthly grant per employee is the amount of HRK 4,000 (€533.33) is to be given to businesses with a slump of more than 60% in their business activities. Also, those employers are exempt from paying contributions in relation to those grants. The fall in business activity will be compared to the volume of business in the second and third quarters of 2019, so as to get a more realistic picture. Some businesses in the hospitality sector will be able to choose whether to compare the current state of affairs on a monthly basis or in relation to the quarters year-on-year. The new set is applicable as of 1 October 2020 and will be on force until the end of the year. The government underscored that to date, the government had disbursed HRK 6.85 billion (€912 million) for the job-retention scheme and that this amount will have risen above HRK 7.2 billion (€960 million) by the end of this year. The latest set has been hammered out following consultations with social partners, employers and trade unions.

                        At the end of March, around 65,000 employers with around 400,000 thousand workers were registered as users of the scheme at the CES. At the end of April, the government has paid more than one and a half billion HRK (€200 million) to preserve jobs for around 485,000 employees. Almost 84,000 employers have received support, including 145 large entrepreneurs.

                        The main criterion for assistance was a 20% drop in turnover. Leading recipients of the grants are big touristic company Valamar Riviera with more than 2,500 employees who have been paid more than eight million HRK (€1.07 million) followed by Boxmark Leather with more than 2,000 employees, Mlinar with 1,737 employees, a car parts manufacturer from Solin AD Plastik with more than 1,500 employees. Of all beneficiaries of the grant 91,78% are micro firms with less than 10 employees, 6,99% are SME with less than 50 employees, 1.06% are medium employers with less than 250 employees, 0.03% are bigger employers with more than 250 employees.

                        According to the data of the Ministry of Labour and Pension System issued in May, the measures included about 550,000 employees. According to the same source, in March and April 2020 alone, the state allocated a total of around HRK 3.5 billion (€467 million) to measures to preserve jobs in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It is estimated that the measures in May 2020 costed the state treasury about HRK two billion (€267 million). Therefore, the state has spent around HRK 5.5 billion (€734 million) in three months of implementing measures to preserve employment in the coronary crisis.
