            <p>
                This is a boosted illness benefit entitlement for workers absent from work due to self-isolation or COVID-related medical treatment. When a worker is told to self-isolate by a doctor or the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) due to being a possible source of infection or has been diagnosed with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) by a doctor, they can apply for an enhanced Illness Benefit payment of €350 per week. To be eligible for this payment a person must be confined to their home or a medical facility.The related legislation is: S.I. No. 97/2020 - Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) (Amendment) (No. 4) (Illness Benefit Payments Arising from Covid-19) Regulations 2020.It was passed on 3 April, but with from 9 March 2020.

                To receive the enhanced payment, a worker must be self-isolating on the instruction of a doctor or the Health Service Executive (HSE) due to being a possible source of infection or diagnosed with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and absent from work and confined to home or a medical facilityThe personal rate for this payment is €350, as compared with the normal Illness Benefit rate of €203. It was originally set at a rate of €305 but was increased by Government on March 24. It will be paid for a maximum of 2 weeks where a person is self-isolating due to being a possible source of infection, and for a maximum of 10 weeks if a person has been diagnosed with COVID-19 (Coronavirus). If a person has been certified for less than 10 weeks, they will be paid for the duration of their certificate.Application can be done online or by post with supporting documentation from an individual worker's doctor.
