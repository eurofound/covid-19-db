            <p>
                In order to guarantee that all workers affected by a temporary collective dismissal or a reduced working time scheme receive as soon as possible their benefits, the government has simplified the administrative procedures whereby companies implementing a temporary collective dismissal ask the unemployment benefit for their employees.In other words, it is not the individual employee that has to initiate the procedure, but the company that has to do so.
