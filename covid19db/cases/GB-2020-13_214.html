                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Self-employed Income Support Scheme was announced by the British government on 26 March 2020 in the context of more stringent lock-down measures which entered into force on 23 March 2020. As such measures required many self-employed individuals to close their businesses or restricted their ability to make a living, the scheme was introduced to bring support in line that available to employees under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                On 26 March 2020 the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme was announced to allow certain groups of self-employed individuals to claim a taxable cash grant worth 80% of average monthly trading profits over the last three years up to a maximum of €2,820 (GBP 2,500) for three months (could be extended). The grant will be subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions but does not need to be repaid. This is intended to match the protection provided to employed individuals, thus covering this group for the first time. The scheme is run directly through Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) which contacts eligible individuals from May 2020 onwards.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                So far unknown. There has been some criticism that businesses are likely to have to wait 5 weeks for first payments to be made (the delay is partly to accommodate firms having to file tax returns - required to be able to claim the benefit). The wait may be difficult for businesses already struggling.
