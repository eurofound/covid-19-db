            <p>
                The scheme addresses businesses who have completely suspended their operation, in accordance with the Degree 101 of the Quarantine Law, Chapter 260 of the Minister of Health. It includes hypermarkets, shopping malls, cafeterias, libraries, sport centers, thematic parks, hairdressing saloons, barber shops, night clubs and pubs, etc.    * On Wednesday 8 April, the President of the Republic announced the decision of the Cabinet to extent the measure up until 12 June 2020. Currently, the Ministry of Labour undertakes a legal and technical processing of the measure.

            <p>
                The basic requirement for participation in the Scheme is that no employee has been fired since 1 March 2020. Additionally, businesses participate in the Scheme should not dismiss any employee during the period of participation, during an additional equal period of participation and plus one additional month after the end period of participation. For companies employing more than nine employees, a Special Unemployment Benefit will be paid to 90% of employees, provided the terms and conditions are met.The remaining 10% shall include managing shareholders, partners holding more than 20% of the shares, general managers and senior executives. For businesses employing up to nine employees, Special Unemployment Benefit may be paid to all employees of the business, irrespective of their statusThe maximum amount that may be paid for a period of month may not exceed 1,214 euros. On the 23 April 2020, the Cabinet amended the calculation of the payable amount to the beneficiaries in order to support as many employees as possible. For the purpose of paying the Scheme, the insurable earnings of the year 2018 will be taken into account, but in addition, a comparison will be made based on the declared salary of January 2020. The payable amount will be the highest amount that results from this comparison.  Additionally, a minimum payable amount of 356 euros has been defined for beneficiaries. Also, a special plan will be implemented for employees who first started work in February and March 2020.The Scheme  includes persons over 65 years of age who do not receive statutory pension and continue to work.  In addition, those for whom the regular unemployment benefits from the Social Insurance Fund have been completed, may join the Scheme to receive a Special Unemployment Allowance.
