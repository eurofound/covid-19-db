            <p>
                As a consequence of the exceptional measures adopted in Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14, published in the BOE of March 14, 2020, the state of alarm was declared for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19, many economic activities have been forced to close down or drastically limit their activity. For this reason, it is necessary to implement a series of measures whose primary objective is to sustain economic activity in the face of the transitory difficulties that are occurring in Spain as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.This measure is aimed at supporting a policy for industrialization, with the aim of continuing to provide liquidity to companies to develop their projects.For this reason, it is established that for a period of two and a half years, extendable by Agreement of the Council of Ministers, the loans granted by the General Secretariat for Industry and SMEs may be refinanced. For the projects currently in execution, the criteria for evaluating the execution of the projects are relaxed, always guaranteeing the fulfillment of the project objectives.

            <p>
                Temporarily, and only for the purposes of the calls for loans granted by the SGIPYME (General Secretariat for Industry and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) that were pending resolution at the time of the entry into force of Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14, which declared the state of alarm for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19, the guarantees to be provided by the applicants will be presented after the resolution of the concession and prior to the payment of the loan.Once the call is resolved, the beneficiaries must provide the guarantees for the amount indicated in the concession resolution and in the modalities established in said calls.The beneficiaries of industrial project loan concessions granted by the SGIPYME may also request modifications to the amortization schedule of the same during the period of 2 and a half years from the entry into force of Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14; as long as the health crisis caused by COVID-19 has caused periods of inactivity of the beneficiary, reduction in the volume of its sales or interruptions in supply in the value chain.
