                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                The housing situation had been a longstanding issue of concern for the Irish public. Mainly due to an undersupply of dwellings, house prices and rents are comparatively among the highest in Europe. Rents or mortgage payments are the largest proportion of income people in Ireland spend. The job or income losses due to the pandemic situation has aggravated this crisis, increasing the difficulty many people face with keeping up with mortgage and rent payments. At the same time, the possibility to find new accomodation is reduced in times of the public health policy with social distancing. As part of its package of 'Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020' the Irish government therefore introduced a restrictions on evictions and rent freezes for landlords.

            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Government  Act includes new measures to protect renters, during the emergency period of 3 months.1. Renters may not be evicted from their home, or 2. be served a notice of termination by their landlord.Notices of termination which the renter had received prior to the emergency period are frozen for the duration of the Emergency (3 months).3. It is also prohibited for landlords to increase rents.All types of rentals are included, such as shared accommodation with the landlord, student accommodation and ‘digs’ type accommodation where meals are provided.Renters shall continue to pay rent and continue to follow any rules as part of their tenancy.Renters having difficulties to pay their rents should contact their landlords and possibly on a reduced amount for the duration of the situation. For those having lost their jobs or part of their employment income, a means tested social welfare, rental support benefit is available.
