                According to Legislative Act 11.03.2020/2020 and Legislative Act 20.03.2020/2020 that were issued, the following measure (in accordance with other legislative measures) was announced for dealing with the potential economic effects of the coronavirus spread (COVID-19) and the support of the economy and entrepreneurship. As such, March and April rent will be reduced by 40% for all businesses the activities of which have been suspended by state decree and for individuals working at such businesses - but only when the home is their primary residence.

                Enterprises, whose operation has been mandatorily suspended or temporarily interrupted based on special  and extraordinary measures taken for precautionary or repressive purposes in relation to the coronavirus spread, shall be exempted from paying 40% of the total amount of rent due for the months of March  and April  2020 for  the commercial premises that they lease (i.e. they can pay only 60% of their rent, in derogation from the legal provisions on leases). Stamp duty and VAT shall be re-calculated and remitted on the amount of rent that will result  following the above partial payment; The above exemption shall also  apply in cases of financial leases of movable or immovable assets intended exclusively to be used for business purposes by the above mentioned enterprises.The above exemption shall also apply for residential leases that concern the primary residence of lessees who are employees of the above mentioned enterprises, on condition that the employment relationship was already in effect at the time the special and extraordinary measures for the suspension or temporary interruption of the enterprise’s operation were imposed; In  a Press Release of 18 March 2020, it was announced that as far as individuals, who are owners of the above mentioned real estate are concerned, (i.e. commercial premises leased to enterprises whose operation has been mandatorily interrupted/primary residences of employees), there will be a four month suspension of payment of their tax obligations and of installments of outstanding taxes in case of settlement or payment facilitation (for the implementation of  the above a further Ministerial Decision is expected to be issued).
