            </h2>
            <p>
                The Austrian government did not want to halt construction work in times of the pandemic, so the social partners in the construction sector worked out, in cooperation with the labour inspectorate, instructions on how to protect workers against the Coronavirus in the construction industry. This resulted in a guide that was published on 26 March 2020. It applies to all workers working on construction sites. The set of instructions complements the general COVID-19 protective measures (i.e. distance of at least one meter to each other; wash hands thoroughly; do not touch your face; cough in the bent elbows or sneeze in a handkerchief, which is then immediately disposed of) - see cases AT-2020-12/590 and AT-2020-12/589 in this database.

            <p>
                To comply with occupational hygiene on the construction site, sanitary measures must be taken in accordance with Section 34 and Section 35 of the Construction Worker Protection Ordinance (BauV). Additional measures in the areas industrial hygiene; organisational measures; work equipment; risk groups; minimization obligation during transport; dormitories; and coordination of work must also be implemented:INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE:- provision of disinfectants and regular disinfection of the sanitary and social facilities on the construction site in short cleaning intervals - when using vehicles, construction machinery or tools, disinfection must be carried out by other personnel before use;- if disinfection is not possible in individual cases, gloves can be used as an alternativeORGANISATIONAL MEASURES:- staggering in terms of time or place to maintain the necessary distance when changing clothes, during breaks - plan work processes according to the technical possibilities so that the number of employees working at one location at the same time is as small as possible.WORK EQUIPMENT:-  if the protective distance of at least one meter cannot be maintained workers  must have mouth-nose protection or a full visorMINIMISATION OBLIGATION DURING TRANSPORT:- the number of employees must be minimised, taking into account the necessary minimum distance of one meterDORMITORIES- must not be occupied by more than one person
