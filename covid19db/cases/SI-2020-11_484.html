            </h2>
            <p>
                The ‘Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act (ZIUZEOP)’ include a set of subsidies for agricultural, forestry enterprises, and fisheries. Farmers who became sick with COVID-19 can ask for financial help for the time while they are incapable of working. Farmers have also the right to ask for financial compensation for the loss of income during the epidemic, while fishermen may claim for 40% subsidy for berths in the port. Another measure obliges public institutions to buy local food.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Farmers and fishermen who became sick with COVID-19 may apply for financial support if they are enrolled in the register of agricultural businesses. Financial support should be equal to real damage, but cannot exceed 80% of the minimum wage.Emergency regulation endows agricultural businesses with the right to financial compensation for the loss of income during the epidemic. The loss of income means the inability of selling supply or lower scale of production if it causes a decrease in revenue by 20%. Agricultural businesses may claim for financial support for the time of epidemic as well as for three succeeding months. The calculation of compensation will be based on a flat rate taking into consideration the number of hectares or livestock units or average catch in the last three years. This support is not compatible with another support under emergency regulation, the monthly basic income (see ‘Monthly basic income’), as one rules out the other.The law obliges public institutions to buy at least 50% of agricultural products from local growers if the purchase value does not exceed a determined sum when the public procurement has to appear in the Official Journal of the European Union. Local food means that it is produced and processed locally. The obligatory purchase of local food will be valid until the end of 2020.

                Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted proposals to the law. The Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry of Slovenia (KGZS) - the umbrella interest organisation of natural and legal persons in the Republic of Slovenia engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishery - was satisfied with the law, saying that its proposals were taken into account to a great extent.Moreover, the law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. Its functioning is momentarily blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, has not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council.
