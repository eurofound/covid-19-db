            <p>
                The employment protection programme Antivirus is designed to help companies to protect jobs. The state will compensate companies – through the Labour Office of the Czech Republic – for wages paid out to employees. This measure will help employers better manage the current situation so that they will not have to resort to layoffs. The wage reimbursement is intended for employers who have to cope with restrictions due to COVID-19 crisis resolutions of the Czech government or whose employees are quarantined. There are two models/regimes of reimbursement depending on the reasons for the obstacle to work (see content of measure).  The government has approved the Antivirus programme to compensate employers’ salary costs from March 12 until the end of April 2020 (for now). The applications for wage compensations refunds have been opened since April 6, 2020 by the Labour Office. The compensation model is based on the German Kurzarbeit model.
