                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                The objective of this measure is to grant access for domestic workers to the extraordinary benefit for lack of activity. A response is accordingly given to the group of domestic workers, especially vulnerable in the current circumstances, given that they do not have the right to unemployment benefit. For this reason, a temporary extraordinary subsidy is created from which they will be able to benefit in the absence of activity, the reduction in hours worked or the termination of the contract as a consequence of COVID-19. The amount of the subsidy will depend on the remuneration previously received, as well as the reduction in activity suffered, requiring proof of such reduction from the employer. This subsidy is compatible with the maintenance of other activities and the maximum amount to be received will be the SMI without extraordinary payments.The health crisis caused by COVID-19 has triggered new situations of need linked to the lack of employment and has aggravated the situation in which previously unemployed people found themselves. Although the state system of unemployment benefits and also the welfare systems of the autonomous communities have served to respond to some of these situations, it is necessary to complete the scope of coverage in order to include new situations of need due to lack of employment generated by the current health crisis.
