            <p>
                As part of the Maltese effort to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, workers were encouraged to work from home where possible. Many Maltese organisations were not in a position to carry out this transition seamlessly, with few organisations offering employees the opportunity to work from home prior to COVID-19. In order to facilitate this change of working method, the government introduced a grant to support employers to invest in technology to facilitate this change.

            <p>
                This call supports employers and self-employed individuals to invest in technology that enables teleworking: the aim of the call is to partially cover the costs involved in making a transition to telework.  Support is limited up to €500 per teleworking agreement and €4,000 per undertaking. The grant shall be awarded against 45% of the eligible cost. In order to be eligible, the employee should not have had an active teleworking agreement prior to the 15th of February 2020. All costs must be incurred after this date. The employee must be able to address their role via teleworking, a formal teleworking agreement must be in place, and they can connect to the work place via a VPN or equivalent solution.
