            <p>
                The COVID-19 outbreak exercised a great pressure on the National Health System and on the people serving therein.On 15 April 2020, the Prime minister has, hence, announced that the government is going to pay an exceptional bonus to healthcare workers.The measure will concern most of the health personnel, with a specific attention to those that have been employed in the departments most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                According to this measure, an exceptional bonus of €1,500 will be paid in May to healthcare workers in the departments most affected by the epidemic and to those in the departments that received COVID-19 patients in the departments least affected. Other health personnel will receive a €500 bonus, he added, specifying that these bonuses will be free of charges and taxes. All of the hospital staff will also receive a 50% increase in overtime, i.e. an average of more than €600 per employee, also without taxes or charges, according to the Minister of Health, Olivier Véran. Each member of staff will therefore receive an average of €1,000 to €2,000, he said, with a total cost to the State of €1.3 billion. In addition to this, there will be a future bonus for staff in the medico-social sector, in particular those in home for the elderly and dependent persons (EHPAD), which have had to reorganise. To launch this bonus, the government has to discuss with local authorities, particularly with the departments that often finance them, to determine the conditions for financing this bonus

                Trade unions highlights that a bonus is not enough. 'A bonus? No way! Announce wage increases if you want to save the public hospital', tweeted the Collectif Inter-Hôpitaux, the spearhead of a strike movement in the sector in recent months. 'These bonuses will never replace the necessary wage increases that have long been demanded by employees,' reacted the CGT Civil Service.
