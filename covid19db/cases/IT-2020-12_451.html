            <p>
                Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 set a legal framework for the suspension of payments of tax deductions, social security and welfare contributions, and insurance premiums for compulsory insurance for work-related accidents (INAIL). To be suspended are those contributions with a legal deadline for compliance and payment over a period of time from 2 March 2020 to 30 April 2020 and, from 2 March 2020 to 31 May 2020 for professional and amateur sports associations and clubs.The measures are differentiated according to the economic sector, the size and location of the company, and aimed at sustaining specific sectors and workers (such as national sport federations, theaters and cinemas, pubs and restaurants, and domestic workers) that are considered most affected by the Covid-19 crisis. The decree extends measures already introduced by Decree Law No. 9/2020 of 2 March 2020 for tourist-accommodation businesses, travel and tourism agencies and tour operators (art. 8).
