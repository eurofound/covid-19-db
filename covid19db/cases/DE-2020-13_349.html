            <p>
                This measure improved liquity for small and medium sized companies that were not in trouble before the COVID-19 outbreak. The new conditions for receiving loans are based on the Rescue package adpoted by the Federal Government in order to provide liquidity to companies during the crisis and are also facilitated by the EU "Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak“. The measure is temporary but no specific timescale was provided.

            <p>
                Given certain preconditons, companies with more than 10 employees can apply for a loan (3% interest rate, running time: maximum 10 years). The companies with more than 50 employees can be granted €800,000. Companies with fewer than 50 employees can apply for a loan worth up to €500,000. Additional risk assessment is currently not applied by the house bank or the KfW (the German Credit Institute for Reconstruction). Latter it will guarantee all such loans (backed by the Federal Government's guarantee to take on all risks in the worst case).Conditions still applicable to receive such a loan are: 1) companies need to have entered the market at least on 1 January 2019; 2) companies must prove not to have been in financial difficulties before the outbreak of the viruses. This means these business must have made a profit in 2019 (or on average over the last three years).
