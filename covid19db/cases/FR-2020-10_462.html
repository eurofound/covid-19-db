                        The short-time working (activité partielle /partial activity or chômage partiel /partial unemployment) is a tool at the service of the public policy of prevention of economic layoffs, which allows the employer in difficulty to have all or part of the cost of the remuneration of his employees covered.

                    <p>
                        This system is an old one and is in general reactivated in times of crisis, as happened also in 2008. It is governed by Articles L. 5122-1 et seq. and R. 5122-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code.

                        In the context of the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the system was relaxed. The partial activity is intended for all employees who suffer a reduction in remuneration attributable to:

                    <p>
                        Requests for partial activity are made by employers if the drop in activity is caused by one of the reasons referred to in Article R. 5122-1 of the Labour Code, including circumstances of an exceptional nature, which apply in the present crisis.

                        <li>
                            The employee receives a partial activity allowance from the employer in lieu of salary for the period during which the employee is placed in partial activity.

                    <p>
                        The short-time working scheme covers all employees of the private sector. With the new provisions adopted to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the partial activity allowance paid by the State to the company - co-financed by the State and by the joint body that manages the unemployment insurance scheme (Unédic) - is no longer a lump sum, but is proportional to the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 'remainder payable' by the employer, i.e. the amount of the remuneration which the employer must pay to the employee, is zero for all employees whose remuneration is less than 4.5 gross SMIC (€45.68 per hour or €6,927.39 per month).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The compensation due to the employee covers at least 70% of his previous gross remuneration, i.e. approximately 84% of the net salary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is nothing to prevent an employer from compensating its employees in excess of 70% of gross salary if it can/wishes to do so or if a collective or company-level agreement so provides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In all cases, a minimum of €8.03 per hour is respected.

                        Specific measures are planned for employees of private employers (cleaning ladies) and childcare assistants (who look after young children) who are usually paid by the hour with a job voucher system.

In fact, all companies using this scheme are now subject to the common law rates, i.e. an allowance paid to employees corresponding to 60% of their previous gross remuneration and an allowance reimbursed to employers equal to 36% of the previous gross remuneration. In order to benefit from more advantageous rates, companies retain the possibility of implementing long-term short-time working (APLD).

                                        On 17 March, in order to cope with the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, the government has announced that the short-time working scheme (common law) or the long-term short-time working scheme (APLD) are part of the measures that can be mobilised by employers as part of the Economic and Social Resilience Plan presented on 16 March by the Prime Minister. In a "question and answer" circular dated 17 March 2022, the Ministry of Labour details their implementation procedures. It also sent two draft texts, an ordinance and a decree, for consult social partners, to the National Commission for Collective Bargaining, Employment and Vocational Training (CNNCEFP) to adapt the APLD system.
                                    </p>

                                        According to the Ministry of Labour, the company that would see its activities slowed down or stopped due to the economic consequences of the conflict in Ukraine can therefore be eligible for partial activity under the "exceptional circumstances" provided for by the Labour Code. On the other hand, this eligibility does not cover a company that voluntarily closes its establishment. No mechanism for increasing the rates of reimbursement is envisaged in relation to the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine. The employees concerned will therefore receive an allowance equal to 60% of their previous gross pay, up to a maximum of 4.5 Smic and a minimum of €8.37. The allowance then reimbursed to the employer will amount to 36% of the employee's previous gross pay, up to a limit of 36% of 4.5 Smic and a floor of €7.53. The remainder borne by the company will amount to 40% of the compensation.

For example, the company can prove that the sharp increase in the price of gas or oil has had a significant impact on the company's business.

                                        Now that "the period of massive recourse to partial activity seems to be over", the organisation that manages partial unemployment schemes, Unédic, has drawn up a report on the state of play of partial unemployment in a study published on 28 February 2022. Unédic concludes that partial unemployment has been and "could in the future remain an important lever for supporting employment". This study underlines that it is mainly small establishments and those in the sectors most affected by health restrictions that have made long-term use of it. On the employee side, it has been widely used, but has particularly helped those close to the minimum wage and on long-term employment contracts (permanent or fixed-term contracts). On the other hand, although it welcomes "the capacity of the system to offer great internal flexibility to companies", Unédic points out that access to training is difficult during the periods of use, and that the financial cost could last.

                                        While it was supposed to end on 28 February 2022, the full coverage of short-time working in the companies most affected by the health crisis remains in force until 31 March 2022. Thus, for those companies that continue to suffer the effects of health restrictions on their activity, the compensation paid to employees in short-time working, as well as the allowance granted to the employer, will continue to be calculated at a rate of 70% of the previous gross remuneration, within the limit of a remuneration capped at 70% of 4.5 Minimum wage (SMIC) and a minimum hourly rate of €8.37.

                                        Most of the sectors and companies that benefit in December 2021 from full coverage of short-time working costs will continue to benefit from it until the end of January 2022, i.e. for an additional month. Two decrees of 27 December provide a framework for this extension and make a few adjustments to the partial activity scheme. Since 1 December 2021, in order to benefit from the increased rates, companies in the so called 'protected sectors' must prove a 65% drop in turnover, instead of the previous 80%. The text also authorises certain employers to use short-time working between 1 January and 31 March 2022, even if they have reached the maximum authorisation period of six months in a year.

                                            An Ordinance of 24 June provides that the rate of partial activity allowances will be set by decree and may be increased for sectors particularly affected by the health crisis. These new rates will be applicable as of 1 June 2020 and until a date that the decree is expected to set at 30 September 2020. The increased rate applies in sectors relating to tourism, hotels, restaurants, sports, culture, air transport and events. Sectors whose activity depends on the above and which are experiencing a very sharp drop in turnover will also benefit. The same will apply to employers whose main activity involves receiving the public and is interrupted due to the epidemic. A decree allow for basic coverage of 85% of the compensation paid and an increased coverage covering these compensation payments in full.

                                            The terms and conditions for implementing the partial activity system are secured and simplified by a decree of 26 June 2020. This decree allows companies with at least 50 establishments to submit a single request for partial activity (for several employees). It also confirms that prior consultation of the Social and Economic Committee (CSE) in the event of recourse to the system is only required for companies with at least 50 employees.

                                            Partial activity for childcare without a school certificate. Since June 2, 2020, parents looking after a child under 16 years of age can only maintain or partially activate their childcare activities upon presentation of a certificate from the childcare establishment, according to the Ministry of Labour. It is therefore no longer sufficient for the employee, as has been the case since 1 May, to send his or her employer a certificate on honour that his or her child cannot attend school. The Ministry of Labour specifies that this certificate from the establishment will be likely to be requested in the event of an administrative control.

                                            A new short-time working scheme will start on 1 October 2020 and provides for an obligation to remain in employment for the duration of the partial activity. The scheme will last three months, renewable, and may not exceed six months (maximum duration of the current scheme). The employees concerned will receive 100% of their net salary at the level of the minimum wage (Smic) at 72% for 1.3 Smic (compared to 84% since the crisis). For high salaries, a ceiling is set at 60% of 4.5 SMIC. Already reduced on 1 June, the State and Unédic allowance will amount to 60% of the compensation paid to employees, with a floor set at 90% of the minimum wage. As a reminder, the State's contribution was 100% of the allowance until 4.5 Smic at the end of March, before being reduced to 85% on 1 June.

                                            A second partial activity scheme came into force on 1 July (see FR-2020-27/1030). Known as "long-term", it concerns companies facing a lasting decline in their activity, such as the aeronautics industry, in order to guarantee a high level of protection. It is for a renewable period of six months and can be mobilised for a maximum of two years, with 100% of the net salary being maintained for employees at the minimum wage and up to 84% for salaries above 1.15 minimum wage, with a ceiling of 70% above 4.5 minimum wage. The State pay 80% of the compensation paid and 85% for agreements signed before 1 October. Its triggering requires a company or branch agreement and validation by the Direccte, and will be based on a diagnosis and forecast of activity and shared employment.

                                        France’s National Assembly and Senate are close to the final adoption (by 10 June) of the emergency bill that contains new provisions for other urgent measures as well as for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. The agreement reached between the two Chambers on 02 June, which has yet to be formally adopted, empowers the Government to further adapt the short time working scheme to take account of the needs of a gradual recovery and to create a special provision for companies permanently affected by the crisis although not likely to fail.

                                        New short time working provision based on collective bargaining and ‘quid pro quos’. A new mechanism that provides long-term support for companies in return for a set of commitments, particularly in terms of maintaining employment, is thus being planned. Both the level of compensation for employees whose activity is reduced and the level of State reimbursement have yet to be established by decree, but the idea is to increase the State element if the company, that has had to make recourse short time working to persevere through the crisis, negotiates or enters into a collective sector agreement, which not only defines the terms of the short time working, but also provides for company commitment in return, and in particular in terms of maintaining employment. This mechanism, known as ‘short time working to maintain employment’, is aimed at ‘companies faced with a lasting reduction in activity and whose survival is not compromised’, under a set of certain conditions and cases that are still to be determined. The agreement and documents implementing the sector agreement with this framework will have to be approved by the labor administration.

                                        Short time working to be adapted from 01 June for six months to facilitate the recovery. The extraordinary short time working scheme was initially set up amid the health crisis, and has been amended several times. It may be amended once more in order to adapt it to the economic recovery and the situation of certain sectors and employees. Once adopted, the bill authorized the government to issue a new ordinance to adapt short time working rules ‘to the specificities of the companies according to the economic impact of the health crisis, their sector of activity and the categories of employees concerned (...).'
Monetizing leave periods. The text also allows a collective agreement to allow for employees who have suffered a reduction in their remuneration due to being placed on short time working, to voluntarily supplement their income by monetizing rest days or paid holidays, for up to a maximum of 5 days. The agreed text also provides that employees under short time working conditions must also benefit from the maintenance of their collective guarantees and that, as an exception, the periods between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020, during which contributing workers received the short time working allowances, would be taken into account for the purposes of enabling the right to a retirement pension.

                                        On 1st June 2020, the financial cover for partial activity (short-time work) will be changed from 70% to 60%. Even if ‘compensation paid to the employee remains unchanged’ (70% of gross salary, i.e. 84% of net salary and at least the net minimum wage), the level covered by the State and the unemployment agency will be lowered so that companies will now be reimbursed up to 60% of gross salary, capped at 4.5x minimum wage, instead of 70%. Sectors subject to special legislative or regulatory restrictions due to the health crisis will continue to benefit from 100% cover. This measure still has to be made the subject of a decree, which will be issued following adoption of a bill treating several health crisis related provisions that is currently under Parliamentary discussion.

According to a report by Unedic, the body that handles partial unemployment, before the health crisis, 30,000 to 40,000 employees were on partial activity each month. By April 2020, there were 8.4 million employees in almost 1.2 million establishments, compared to just over 250,000 at the height of the 2008-2009 economic crisis. The number of employees concerned has fallen sharply, to around 200,000 in October and November 2021.

However, in case of exceptional circumstances, the advice of the work council can be sent to the public authorities (DIRECCTE) in the two months after the start of the short-time working scheme.
