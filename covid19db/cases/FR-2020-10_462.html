            <p>
                Link to case FR-2020-10/217The short-time working (activité partielle /partial activity or chômage partiel /partial unemployment) is a tool at the service of the public policy of prevention of economic layoffs, which allows the employer in difficulty to have all or part of the cost of the remuneration of his employees covered. This system is an old one and is in general reactivated in times of crisis, as happened also in 2008. It is governed by Articles L. 5122-1 et seq. and R. 5122-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code. In the context of the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the system was relaxed.The partial activity is intended for all employees who suffer a reduction in remuneration attributable to :- either a reduction in the working hours practiced in the establishment or part of the establishment below the legal working hours (35 hours);- a temporary closure of all or part of the establishment.Requests for partial activity are made by employers if the drop in activity is caused by one of the reasons referred to in Article R. 5122-1 of the Labour Code, including circumstances of an exceptional nature, which apply in the present crisis.During the period of partial activity :- The employer receives from the public authorities (Services and Payment Agency - ASP) an allowance equivalent to a share of the hourly pay of the employee placed in partial activity;- The employee receives a partial activity allowance from the employer in lieu of salary for the period during which the employee is placed in partial activity.

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The short-time working scheme cover all employees of the private sector. With the new provisions adopted to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the partial activity allowance paid by the State to the company - co-financed by the State and by the joint body that manages the unemployment insurance scheme (Unédic) - is no longer a lump sum, but is proportional to the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity. The 'remainder payable' by the employer, i.e. the amount of the remuneration which the employer must pay to the employee, is zero for all employees whose remuneration is less than 4.5 gross SMIC (€45.68 per hour or €6,927.39 per month).The compensation due to the employee covers at least 70% of his previous gross remuneration, i.e. approximately 84% of the net salary.There is nothing to prevent an employer from compensating its employees in excess of 70% of gross salary if it can/wishes to do so or if a collective or company-level agreement so provides.In all cases, a minimum of €8.03 per hour is respected.Specific measures are planned for employees of private employers (cleaning ladies) and childcare assistants (who look after young children) who are usually paid by the hour with a job voucher system.

            </h2>
            <p>
                As of April 7, 2020, 692,000 applications for partial activity have been filed. They concern 669,000 establishments and 6,300,000 employees (2.3 million more than on 31 March).  About 59% of employees who have applied for partial activity since 1 March work in establishments with fewer than 50 employees. These establishments account for 34% of private salaried employment. Conversely, those working in establishments with more than 250 employees account for 15% of employees in partial activity, while these establishments account for 20% of private salaried employment.The Ministry of Labour (DARES and DGEFP) and the public employment service Pôle Emploi have decided to update these data every weeks. The last issue of 7 April is available with this link:https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr/dares-etudes-et-statistiques/tableaux-de-bord/marche-du-travail-pendant-le-covid-19/article/situation-sur-le-marche-du-travail-au-7-avril-2020

                The works council has to be consulted before the first employee is placed in the short-time working scheme. However, in case of exceptional circumstances, the advice of the work council can be sent to the public authorities (DIRECCTE) in the two months after the start of the short-time working scheme.
