                                        The legislation in question also provides for the employer to make available the work and the communication tools and equipment necessary for the provision of work, and when such availability is not possible and the worker consents, it establishes that telework can be carried out through the means that the worker has, and the employer is responsible for the proper programming and adaptation to the needs inherent to the provision of telework (Paragraphs 5 and 6).

                                        On the other hand, when the employee is not able to provide service under a teleworking regime, namely due to the lack of adequate technical or housing conditions, he/she must inform the employer, in writing, of the reasons for his/her impediment (paragraph 7).

                                        The law made it clear that the teleworker has the same rights and duties as other workers, without any possibility of reducing pay, under the terms provided for in the Labour Code or in collective agreements. Due to a set of doubts that were raised during the first generalization of telework in the pandemic context, in March 2020, the Decree-Law expressly states the limits of the normal working period and other working conditions, health and safety at work and the repair of damages arising from an accident at work or occupational disease, while maintaining the right to receive the meal allowance that was already due (paragraph 8).

                        With basis on Labour Force Survey ad hoc module ‘Working from home’, Statistics Portugal reported that, in the second quarter of 2020,1,094.4 thousand employed people declared having worked always or almost always from home (in the reference week or in the three weeks before), which represented a share of 23.1% of the total employed population; and that for 91.2% of these the main reason for having worked at home was the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistics Portugal highlights that 1.04 million people used information and communication technologies to be able to work from home, a share of 21.9% of the total employed population and 94.8% of those who worked always or almost always at home in the reference period.

                        In the third quarter of 2020, the share of the employed population who has worked remotely 
decreased to 14.2% of the employed population; and in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased to 12.3% of the employed population (597,500 people). In both quarters around 79% of the people that worked from home indicated the main reason was the COVID-19 pandemic.

                        The study ‘The adaptation of working organizational models in Central Public Administration during COVID-19 pandemics: difficulties and opportunities’ [A adaptação dos modelos de organização do trabalho na Administração Pública Central durante a pandemia COVID-19: Dificuldades e oportunidades] was carried out by the Department of Development of Organizational Models (DDMO) of the General Directorate of Administration and Public Employment (DGAEP). This study aimed at evaluating the adaptation of organizational models in central public administration during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely in relation to telework. The main objectives referred to mapping the profiles of workers in telework, the diversity of problems identified in its implementation, the reasons limiting the extension of this regime to more workers; and identifying the challenges of management and adaptation to new forms and rhythms of work, articulation with colleagues and supervisors, measuring the impact at the management level, of the communication and strategy of public organizations. The study was based on interviews with the 29 top managers of central administration services – General Directorates, General Secretariats and General Inspections (Direct Administration) and Public Institutes (Indirect Administration) – conducted online, between June and September 2020; and on a survey applied online between 5 and 22 January 2021, having obtained 4,445 responses (in a universe of 42,810 workers).

                            The interviews revealed that “communication” was the main challenge referred by 70% of the Direct Administration top level managers and by 67% of Indirect Administration. Challenges were also felt by top level management in relation to coordination of teams (by 35% of the Direct and 44% of the Indirect), of equipment (by 30% of the Direct and 44% of the Indirect), of processes (by 20% of Direct and 22% of Indirect), and of personal and emotional issues (by 20% of Direct and 11% of Indirect). Also noteworthy is the fact that 22 of the 29 managers interviewed explained that the return to in-office work, since June 2020, was done essentially, through rotation of workers between in-office work and telework or occasional or regular combination of the two, therefore in practice pointing to hybrid solutions.

                            The survey revealed that between 5 and 22 January 2021 – a period coincidental with the state of emergency and the highest crisis of COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal – around 27.2% of the workers of the sample worked in-office; 17.3% worked exclusively in telework; 17.4% worked only very occasionally in-office; 22.0% worked with some regularity in office; and around 14.3% rotate between in-office work and teleworking.

                            Considering a set of potential advantages (multiple answer) arising from teleworking, 72% of respondents identifies the “time saving by avoiding travel” as the main advantage. Conversely, the "contribution to the reduction of pollution due to the decrease in travel" is, within the positive aspects, the least valued by respondents. Most relevant positive points arising from telework: time saved by avoiding travel (72%); positive effect on the reconciliation of professional, family and personal life (54%); contributes to rethinking the organizational models of the work in Public Administration (53%); greater freedom in managing and executing tasks (45%); savings on expenses arising from travel (43%); positive effect in reducing pollution due to reducing displacements (32%).

                        The newly formed (on18 May 2021, National Council of Employers' Confederations (CNCP) including all employer confederations  [the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal (CAP), the Confederation of Commerce and Services of Portugal (CCP), the Business Confederation of Portugal (CIP), the Confederation of Tourism of Portugal (CTP) and the Portuguese Confederation of Construction and Real Estate (CPCI)] -  opposed the government's decision maintaining compulsory teleworking until 13 June 2021 to all municipalities arguing that this extension “conflicts with other constitutionally protected rights, freedoms and guarantees, such as the development of economic activity, which it presupposes the freedom to determine its mode of organization and functioning” as, it stands out, is in the Constitution. Moreover CNCP stressed that the government ignored its own provisions applying mandatory teleworking only  in municipalities considered (...) as being of high, very high and extreme risk in terms of COVID-19 pandemic.
