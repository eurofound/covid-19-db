                'There are very specific measures for the arts and culture to cover the special features of the cultural scene. But of course artists also have access to the entire range of support. We want to prevent people from losing their jobs, their income and at all costs everyday life can no longer afford. Nobody should be left behind ' explains State Secretary for Art and Culture Ulrike Lunacek on the unprecedented situation, which is very challenging for the entire art and culture business.The federal government's mix of measures to combat the effects of COVID-19 includes a range of support for the cultural sector.

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                An overview of measures for artists is available on the Federal government's page:https://www.bmkoes.gv.at/Themen/Corona/Corona-Kunst-und-Kultur.htmlIn addition to the general support measures set by government (e.g. Corona short time work: AT-2020-12/229; or the hardship fund for selfemployed AT-2020-12/213), the page also lists specific funds which are only available for artists.This includes, for instance:- COVID-19 fund for artists and intermediaries ('Kulturvermittler');- all artists who are not eligible to apply the hardship fund of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce can bring an application to the KSVF (Artist Social Insurance Fund) from 30 March 2020. The support is intended to compensate for the loss of income caused by closings and cancellations. The COVID 19 fund is endowed with up to €5 million and is intended to ensure rapid aid. In addition to artists, cultural mediators can now apply for this grant. The amount paid out by the KSVF corresponds to that of the hardship fund. A total of a maximum of €6,000 will be paid out - in the first phase up to €1,000 euros, in the second phase up to €2,000 euros per month for a maximum of three months.A separate service page has been set up for loss of income due to the Corona measures: KSVF service fund.Individual funds run by copyright collecting societies (e.g. music, visual arts, film-making, etc.). Seven dedicated funds are also listed on the webpage.In addition to the state instruments for compensating artists' loss of income, there is now also a private initiative. To help artists in the current crisis, foundations have joined together to form the "Foundations Help Artists" initiative and are supported by well-known people.Work grants from the City of Vienna due to COVID-19: Since the end of March, freelance artists and freelance scientists with their main residence in Vienna have been able to apply for one-time work grants of up to €3,000. In this crisis situation, there should be the opportunity to continue to pursue artistic and scientific activities (project development, reading, exhibition and lecture preparation and the like).
