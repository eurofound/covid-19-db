                Background information
            </h2>
            <p>
                Key tax and spending measures have been implemented under the revised 2020 state budget, allowing for a budget deficit of BGN 3.5 billion (€1,75 billion) and increased ceiling on newly incurred public debt of up to BGN 10 billion (approx. €5 billion) for 2020. By doing so, the Bulgarian government is able to implement a measure that will cover 60% of the wages of employees in affected sectors that would otherwise have been laid off, including the social security contributions that are to be paid by the employers (over 1.2 percent of 2019 GDP). 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Emergency and Measures Act adopted measures to compensate for the businesses affected by the epidemic. The following types of activities remain outside the scope of the measures - Classes A - Agriculture, K - Financial and Insurance Activities, O - Government, P - Education, Q - Human Health and Social Work, T - Household Activities as Employers, and U - activities of extraterritorial organizations and services. All other companies outside the above may apply for compensation. Those whose activities that are directly prohibited by restrictive measures do not need to prove a reduction in their income (it is presumed). Businesses that do not have a direct prohibition of activity may apply if their earnings in the month preceding the application have decreased by 20% compared to the same month in 2019. In addition, the employer cannot dismiss employees for whom he or she receives compensation, after the end of the state of emergency for an additional period equal to that for which he was compensated. Employers will be able to establish part-time work for the whole enterprise or its unit and at the same time receive compensation in proportion to the reduced working hours.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Use of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                More than 80% of employees can benefit from the measures and most of the employers in the country. So far, (mid April 2020) over 800 companies have benefited from the measure.
