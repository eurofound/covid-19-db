            </h2>
            <p>
                Temporary Emergency Measure for the Preservation of Jobs is a financial aid programme for enterprises hit by the COVID-19.This measure has been introduced as a bunch of emergency solutions specifically to combat or cushion the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. More specifically, this measure is aimed at taking over the wage costs so that enterprise do not get bankrupted and that employees get an income. This applies to workers with permanent as well as flexible or temporary contracts.The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) till the pandemic is under control.This measure is part of the package of emergency measures to deal with the corona virus. This was a package of several measures which have been taken to combat the COVID-19 and its effects announced on March 17th, 2020.

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The aim is to help enterprises to pay the salaries of their employees so that employment as well as business viability can be maintained as much as possible. Financial aid is made available for those enterprises that suffer a revenue loss of more than 20%.  The government subsidizes up to 90% of the wage costs of staff for a period of up to three months. This applies to workers on permanent contracts as well as flexible contracts (including zero hour "nul uren" contracts, or on call contracts "oproep contracten"). However, in return enterprises may not fire anyone (fixed and flexible employment contracts alike), for economic reasons during the period of time covered by the allowance.  It should be noted that given the ever evolving situation, the government also considers extending this measure beyond the initially intended 3 months.

                (As with the other measures (and consequently, the other cases): Though not discussed in great detail, the social partners (national level trade unions and employer organisations), have come together to discuss with the government how best to tackle the effects of the corona virus on workers and employers so as to keep the Dutch economy going. In the Netherlands relevant, national sectoral social partners are often involved in national policy making in a consultational capacity so that partners may reflect on regulatory plans and their intended impacts. This happens in a direct consultation fashion or through tripartite meetings (facilitated by the National Labour Foundation). The social partners were consulted for the whole package of measures introduced by the Dutch cabinet on March 17th 2020.)
