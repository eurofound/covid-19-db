            </h2>
            <p>
                The cultural sector has been strongly affected by the Corona outbreak due to the restrictions on public gatherings and the cancellation of all public cultural events. The Ministry of Culture has proposed a measure to support the freelance creative persons by mitigating the conditions for applying for a  support benefit. The support is paid from the Ministry to the artistic associations who use it as 1) support to creative persons engaged in a liberal profession for creative activity and 2) grants for the creative activities of creative persons. Changes to the conditions are foreseen in the Creative Persons and Artistic Associations Act, but it is dependent on the approval of the supplementary state budget which is currently being discussed by the Parliament.
            </p>

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                The changes are meant for creative persons, who are not in civil service or not employed on the basis of an employment contract or similar contract, and who are active in the following artistic fields: 1) architecture; 2) audiovisual arts; 3) design; 4) performing arts; 5) sound arts; 6) literature; 7) visual arts or 8) scenography.The changes foresee, that the support for creative persons must be used solely for creative persons support (and not for grants and trainings) until the end of 2020, in case specifically allowed by the Ministry. Additionally, current eligibility criteria for the support will be relaxed:- a person can apply for the support if at least two years have passed since the end of the previous support period - this restriction will be abolished- a person cannot apply for the support if they have received other income under service contract the previous month and they cannot receive income while receiving the support - the changes will allow income in the sum of national minimum wage.These measures will be in force during the emergency situation and six months afterwards.A total of €5.2 million is expected to be used for the measure.

            <p>
                Currently, the regular support is paid for around 100 creative persons. It is expected that additional 1,200 persons will receive the support.
