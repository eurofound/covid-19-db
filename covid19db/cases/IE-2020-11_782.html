                        The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is an emergency payment of €350 per week introduced by the Irish government for a 12 week period and intended to compensate those workers whose employers cannot retain them on their payroll. The payment will also be made to people who are self-employed but whose trade has temporarily ceased.

                    <p>
                        Workers are eligible to apply for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment if they were in employment or self-employment immediately before Friday 13 March, and have been temporarily laid-off from work or asked to stay at home from work where their employer is not in a position to retain them on their payroll.

                        In addition, regulation Nr. S.I. No. 95/2020, amendment 3, temporarily suspend the rule in section 62(4) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which provides that Jobseeker’s Benefit is paid only from the fourth day of unemployment. The measure is being introduced to mitigate the impact on employers and employees arising from COVID-19 and will apply from the 19 March 2020 until 10 August 2020 inclusive. For that period, Jobseeker’s Benefit will be paid from the first day of unemployment.

                                        <strong>
                                            “When the Pandemic Unemployment Payment was launched in March 2020, it was paid at a flat rate. This meant that everyone who received the payment was getting the same amount of weekly income support. The rate of payment was not based on previous income or the number of hours worked. This meant that everyone who needed income support was able to get it quickly. As a result, some recipients, mainly working a lower number of hours, received a higher amount of income support than from their previous employment. It is important that the social welfare system is fair - that is why changes have been made to the rate of payment. If you receive a lower rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, it will still be greater than the amount you previously earned from your employer.”

                        A paper by the Department of Social Protection found: "The early waves of those seeking PUP payments were more likely to be women, aligning with the high share of women employed in Accommodation and Food Services and in Wholesale and Retail. Indeed, 54% of those employed in Accommodation and Food Services in Q4 2019 were women, whilst 56% were under 35 years of age. This is higher than the average for those working in the four sectors collectively designated above as ‘severely impacted’. Later waves, however, saw an increase in the share of men claiming the payment as well as those aged 35 to 54 years as operations in the construction industry ceased on March 27th."
