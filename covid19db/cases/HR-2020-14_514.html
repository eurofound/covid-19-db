            </h2>
            <p>
                Many small-scale dairy producers have serious business problems caused by the COVID-19 epidemic because nobody can withdraw and buy their daily production of milk. At the same time, some institutions of social welfare and hospitals do not have enough quantities of milk. Therefore, there was a need for government action to aid them and to save milk production. The Ministry of Agriculture will determine the list of small dairies that are eligible for the support from this Decision.
            </p>

                Content of measure

            <p>
                This Decision establishes a provisional emergency measure to assist small-scale dairies with business problems caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. The activity consists of withdrawing and buying dairy production of dairies which have an annual production up to 14 million liters of raw milk. The withdrawal and purchase of surpluses from small dairies also ensures the smooth continued production and supply of milk. Recipients are obliged to ensure that all necessary measures are considered during withdraw and distribution of dairy products, in accordance with the instructions and decisions of the Civil Protection Authorities of the Republic of Croatia and local civil protection headquarters.

            <p>
                In addition to assisting small dairies and ensuring the smooth production of milk on farms, this Decision provides for quantities of dairy products intended for free of charge distribution. The recipients of the dairy products referred to in this Decision will be intermediaries in the food donation chain, registered in the Register of Food Donors, maintained by the Ministry of Agriculture. Furthermore, recipients will be also hospitals, social welfare centers and social welfare institutions managed or recognized by the competent authorities.
