            <p>
                This measure provides employees with a basic wage cover in view of the disruption caused by the COVID pandemic to certain industries. Funds are forwarded to employers who are in turn obliged to forward these to their employees. Full time employees in specific sectors will receive €800 a month from the government through their employers. As part of the agreement, employers in these sectors will continue providing their workers with a further €400 a month. Employers who were too highly impacted by the pandemic and cannot afford the further €400 must register with the Department of industrial relations.

This is also applicable to self-employed individuals. Part-time employees are eligible for €500 a month.

                Consultation was carried out in the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (MCESD), a tripartite body, with the government announcing that agreement was reached in this forum.Employer associations were vocal in the press following the official announcement stating their agreement with the new measures. Some employers in sectors which have not been included in the measures have also been vocal in the press that their workers should also be included. These include those in marketing and real estate.
