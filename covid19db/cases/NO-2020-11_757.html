            <p>
                To maintain operations in the health and care services and other critical society functions during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Norwegian Directorate of Health made exceptions to the closure order of kindergartens and educational institutions. Managers of childcare centres and headteachers in primary schools were required to provide a service for children of healthcare personnel, personnel in the transport sector or within other critical society functions. Parts of the kindergarten and school services has thus been open to keep personnel critical to society in service.

            <p>
                In order to stop the spread of Covid-19 and to contribute to the maintenance of necessary health and care services, the Norwegian Directorate of Health has issued, according to the Infection Control Act, a decision to close schools and other educational institutions with effect from 16 Mars 2020. However, to maintain operations in the health and care services and other critical society functions, and to avoid the use of people in risk groups for babysitting, the Norwegian Directorate of Health made exceptions to the closure order. Managers of childcare centres and headteachers in primary schools were required to provide a service for children of healthcare personnel, personnel in the transport sector or within other critical society functions. The same applies to children with special care needs that cannot be taken care of when childcare, school or other day care facilities are closed. The emergency response committee considers the following 15 functions to be critical to society: Government and crisis management; Defence; Law and order; Health and care services; Rescue services; IT security in the civilian sector; Nature and environment; Security of supply; Water and wastewater; Financial services; Power supply; Electronic communication services; Transport; Satellite-based services; Pharmacies.
