            <p>
                Freelance artists will be entitled to one minimum wage, together with social security contributions, for the period of emergency plus one month thereafter - that is, for 3 months. The money will be donated through the Culture Fund and will be applied for online and by mail. The criteria are to be announced. Acceptance of applications and then disbursements should start by 15 April 2020. The idea is to support the most needy artists, who have relatively lower incomes compared to others in their industry.

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Artists who had monthly incomes of less than BGN 1,000 (€500) last year could benefit from the support. The measure will cost BGN 2,7 million (€1,35 million) to the budget of the Ministry of Culture.More projects are being considered through the National Culture Fund, for example a drastic increase the budgets of these projects. So far, 10% of their value has been for administrative expenses. In addition, the duration of many cultural projects, which have been delayed by the pandemic, will be extended. In this way the ministry hopes to sustain art teams.There are around 2,200 freelance artists in Bulgaria. According to preliminary estimates, at least 50% of them will be able to benefit from the measure.
