            </h2>
            <p>
                With state restrictions on movement to curb the coronavirus, experts fear an increase in domestic violence. To counteract this, a package of measures was first presented by the government on 19 March.  The criminal prosecution of the perpetrators would be further ensured, entry and proximity bans would be further pronounced, and directions would be implemented. This would mean that the police can give those affected by domestic violence applications for an injunction against violent partners at first contact and take the completed forms with them on inspection visits a few days later. Applications can also be submitted electronically. The removal of violent offenders would also be guaranteed in quarantine areas. On 5 April, new measures where presented and figures showing a slight decrease in the number of domestic violence cases.
            </p>

                Content of measure
            </h2>
            <p>
                When presenting measures in mid-March, it was emphasised that the 24-hour helpline had been increased in terms of funding and staff and that online advice for women at risk of violence was expanded. Furthermore, information brochures on the protection against violence were being published, to be distributed in supermarkets. A professional online help and advice service ("help chat") has been available from 19 March 2020 every day from 3 pm to 10 pm for women and girls affected by violence, in several languages (German, English, Turkish, Farsi / Dari (Persian), Russian, Bulgarian and Arabic).
            </p>
            <p>
                On 5 April, the interior minister presented a new campaign ‘Safe at home’ (Halt der Gewalt), which is designed to help women with violent partners. He appealed to victims of domestic violence, mostly women and children, not to remain silent. Police officers would know exactly what to do in a specific case, they were ‘trained to decide exactly that’ - and also for prevention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the weekend, there has been extensive information and services on the subject of violence in the family on the website of the Ministry of the Interior, and additional advertisements since Sunday. The Ministry has announced ‘Prevention Spots’ for next week. The information is available in several languages.
