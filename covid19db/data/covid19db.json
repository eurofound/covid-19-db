            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "As part of the \u20ac4 billion fund to mitigate the effects of the Corona crisis, which the Austrian national government and the social partners presented on 14 March 2020, they also presented two hardship funds: one for self-employed in one person companies; and the other for family-run businesses. This was complementary to other measures (see case AT-2020-12-/229), as those two target groups would not be able to profit from the short-time working schemes.\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The support is a one-off payment and does not have to be paid back. In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:\r\r* **Phase 1**: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is \u20ac500 if the net income p.a. was below \u20ac6,000 and \u20ac1,000 if it was above \u20ac6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is \u20ac33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accomodation rents) and freelance workers.\r* **Phase 2**: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at \u20ac2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.\rAll applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to \u20ac6,000. \r\rIn general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 December 2020. ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Info from 1 April: Around 100,000 applications for phase 1 were counted so far. The total funds for the hardship fund were increased from \u20ac1 to 2 billion.\r\rInfo from 20 April: The first phase has been completed with 144,000 applications made. A total of \u20ac121 million. was paid out in the first phase. ",

The grant will be subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions but does not need to be repaid. This is intended to match the protection provided to employed individuals, thus covering this group for the first time.

This means that they met the income and trading activity criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment returns from 2018-19 and earlier years. However, some of these businesses will not have continued trading since 2018-19 or will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus so will not be eligible.\r\r* On the 13 May, there had been 441,000 claims made, with a total value of \u00a31.3 billion. \r* By the 31 May, the total number of claims was 2.5 million, with a value of \u00a37.2 billion. \r* By the 30 June, the total number of SEISS claims was 2.6 million (75% of the potentially eligible population), with a value of \u00a37.7 billion.\u00a0\u00a0The average value per claim was \u00a32,900.\r\rAround two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m).\u00a0A lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (70%) compared to males (78%).\u00a0 The average claim for females is also lower at \u00a32,300 compared to the average claim for males of \u00a33,200. By 30 June, HMRC had received 1,805,000 claims from men totalling \u00a35.7bn compared to 745,000 claims from women for \u00a31.7bn.\r\rAround 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 75%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.\u00a0 The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (60% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at \u00a33,300. The youngest age group have the second lowest take up rate (68%) and the lowest average claim value at \u00a32,100.\r\rThe sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 30 June, construction workers had made 867,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a33.1bn, an average of \u00a33,500 per claimant.\u00a0 Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 221,000 claims totalling \u00a3481m. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 193,000 claims totalling \u00a3399m.\r\rThe two regions with the highest number of claims are London (484,000) and the South East (373,000), reflecting their relative sizes.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced by the British government on 20 March 2020 in the context of more stringent lock-down measures which entered into force on 23 March 2020. The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees\u2019 (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to 2,820 Euros (\u00a32,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.\r\rEmployers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.\r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The scheme has been critizised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures). The scheme is set to be up and running by the end of April 2020 with the possibility of claiming payments in arrears.\r\rBy the 19 July (the latest available data), the total number of jobs furloughed was\u00a09.5 million, with 1.2 million employers utilising the scheme, at a total cost to the government of\u00a0\u00a329.8 billion (HM Government, 2020).",
            "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Please note that the UK does not have formal institutional settings for involvement in the design, implementation and monitoring of policies although often, there will be information exchange and consultation, conducted on informal bases (this exists in addition to formal responses from the social partners to official consultations).\r\rIt is reported that the Chancellor held discussions with both the CBI and the TUC before launching the raft of emergency measures at the start of the epidemic.

                    "updates::description": "On the 12 June 2020, the Government released a raft of further guidance concerning the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), with the changes to be implemented from 1 July 2020. The new and updated guidance sets out who will be eligible from 1 July 2020 and explains how \u201cflexible furlough\u201d will operate. From the 1 July, employers will be able to bring back furloughed workers on a flexible pattern (ie for any amount of time and on any work pattern). Employers will be able to claim a CJRS grant for the hours which flexibly furloughed employees do not work, compared to the hours they would normally have worked in that period. \rIf an employer wishes to flexibly furlough staff, they will need to obtain their employees\u2019 agreement and keep a written agreement that confirms the new furlough arrangement. This agreement must be kept for 5 years. Employers must also keep records of how many hours their employees work and the numbers of furloughed hours for 6 years.  \r\r\rAlso from this date, employers will only be able to claim a grant for employees who have already been furloughed for three consecutive weeks between the 1st of March and the 30th of June. Thus, the last date an employee could have started furlough for the first time was the 10th of June. Companies are thus no longer able to furlough new employees, unless they have returned from maternity, shared parental, paternity or parental bereavement leave after the 10th of June. These employees can be furloughed after 10 June provided that:\r\r* the employer has previously submitted a CJRS claim for another\u00a0employee in the organisation between 1 March and 30 June 2020;\r* the employee is being furloughed for the first time;\r* the employee started their Shared Parental Leave before 10 June\u00a0and returned from that leave after 10 June 2020; and\r* the employee was on the employer\u2019s PAYE payroll on or before 19 March 2020.\r\rFrom 1 July, the number of employees that employers can claim for in any single claim period cannot exceed the maximum number of employees that the employer claimed for under any claims ending by 30 June. For example, if an employer previously submitted three claims between 1 March and 30 June 2020, in which the total number of employees furloughed was 20, 30 and 50 employees respectively, the maximum number of employees that the employer can furlough in any single claim from 1 July 2020 will be 50.\r\rThe scheme has been extended until the 31st of October. The Government will continue to pay 80% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500 in July, as well as national insurance and pension contributions. However, from the 1 of August, the level of government grant provided through the scheme will be limited and employers\u2019 contributions will rise. \r\r\rThe timetable for changes to the scheme is as follows: \r\r* There are no changes to grant levels in June\r* In June and July, the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500 for the hours the employee is on furlough, as well as employer National Insurance Contributions (ER NICS) and pension contributions for the hours the employee is on furlough. Employers will have to pay employees for the hours they work.\r* For August, the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500 for the hours an employee is on furlough and employers will pay ER NICs and pension contributions for the hours the employee is on furlough\r* For September, the government will pay 70% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,187.50 for the hours the employee is on furlough. Employers will pay ER NICs and pension contributions and top up employees\u2019 wages to ensure they receive 80% of their wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500, for time they are furloughed\r* For October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of \u00a31,875 for the hours the employee is on furlough. Employers will pay ER NICs and pension contributions and top up employees\u2019 wages to ensure they receive 80% of their wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500, for time they are furloughed.\r\rEmployers will continue to able to choose to top up employee wages above the 80% total and \u00a32,500 cap for the hours not worked at their own expense if they wish. Employers will have to pay their employees for the hours worked.\r\rWage caps are proportional to the hours not worked.\r\r\u00a0(Source: HM Government, 2020).",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "A short-time work scheme applies if a company temporarily reduces the working time. In order to prevent dismissals and to protect businesses and employees from negative economic and social impacts of COVID-19, social partners (Chamber of Labour, Trade Unions, Economic Chamber) negotiated the current scheme. \r\rWorking hours of employees can be reduced up to zero hours keeping full / almost full pay. The employer only pays for the actual working time. \r\rReduced working hours: The reduced standard working hours must be on average between 10% and 90% of standard working hours as agreed under collective working arrangements. A new aspect of this is that it may temporarily also be set at zero. Thus, for instance, in the context of a short-time working period of six weeks, it may be set at 0% for five weeks (i.e. no work will take place, and for one week at 60%). Another important point to note is that, in some business sectors, the agreement on short-time work may also include overtime.\r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of 14 April 2020, short-time work applications have been made for the jobs of 608,607 people, in mid-May, over 1.3 million persons were on short-time work.\rThe funds have been increased several times, from originally \u20ac3 billion to currently (mid-June) \u20ac12 billion in mid-May.\r\rThe Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth maintains a regularly updated [webpage on labour market statistics](https://www.bmafj.gv.at/Services/News/Aktuelle-Arbeitsmarktzahlen.html), which keeps track of the number of persons currently in short-time work. Peak numbers were reached during three weeks in May, during which more than 1.3 millino persons were on short-time work. Numbers have then gradually declined and stood at around 403.000 persons on 6 July 2020. \r",

Business activity of the SME has to be included at the supported economic activities list, which is, however, very wide and included accommodation, logistics, manufacturing industry etc. \r\r\u010cMZRB will secure the commercial loan up to 80% with the maximum period of 3 years. SME can also apply for financial support on the loan interest up to CZK 1,000,000 (\u20ac36,298 approx.). Loan to be secured are limited to CZK 15,000,000 (\u20ac544,465). The loans are intended to cover salaries, rent, utility costs and supplier-customer invoices. \r\rThe total amount for COVID II programme is CZK 4,000,000,000 (\u20ac145,190,563).\r\rThe program is financed from the EU Structural Funds within the OPPIK and is therefore not intended for the implementation of projects in the capital city of Prague.

The Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic (Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 komora \u010cesk\u00e9 republiky) realised in April 2020 a survey among its members, who highlighted the tangle of bureaucracy and lack of clarity in the COVID I and COVID II. To apply, companies needed to complete complex forms forecasting the next three years, which is an impossibility in the current situation.

These amendments shorten the notice period for temporary lay-offs. \r\rIn Finland, employers are responsible for informing about temporary lay-offs. In normal circumstances, the notice period for temporary lay-offs is 14 days. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Act was amended in March 2020 and therefore the notice period will be 5 days  between April and June 2020. \r\rMany collective agreements further regulate the notice period for temporary lay-offs and these regulations laid down in collective agreements shall apply. In accordance with Chapter 13, this regulation may differ from the notice period regulated in Employment Contracts Act. Even during the period the temporary provision is in force, employers shall follow the rules set in the collective agreement. \r\rHowever, approximately 90% of employees who work for employers who are members to peak-level employers's organisation Confederation of Finnish Industries EK are covered by collective agreements that have been temporarily adapted to follow this legislative amendment. \r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure covers all employers that need to temporarily lay off personnel. \r\rEmployees may be laid off when the potential of the employer to offer work has diminished (either temporarily or permanently) and the employer cannot provide the employee with other suitable work or training. \r\rThe right to shortened notice period is not applicable to the public sector employers. \r\rThere are no direct monetary aspects involved in this measure. However, considering that during the notice period companies must pay employees' salary whereas during lay-offs the state and unemployment funds pay out unemployment allowance (or labour market subsidy) for the employees, the shortened notice period has significant financial benefits for companies as it allows them to faster adapt to the COVID-19 related market disturbances. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r",

The incentive was primarily aimed at companies and self-employed who suffer a significant downturn in their turnover. A sum of a reduction in 25% is quoted and it aims to target the following sectors but is not limited to them:  tourism and hospitality, entertainment, transport, and manufacturing sectors.  Enterprises will still collect National Insurance on their employees\u2019 wages, but will keep these dues for the duration of the deferral. \r\rThe eligible taxes to be deferred are those due in March and April 2020 and include: provisional tax, employee taxes, maternity fund payments and social security contributions, social security contributions of self-employed persons and VAT.\r\rEligible taxes, other than VAT, are to be settled in 4 equal monthly installments between May and August 2020. VAT is to be settled in 2 equal installments with the 2 quarterly returns that follow the deferred quarter. \r\rExcluded from this initiative are companies and self-employed persons who failed to comply with their tax obligations by 31 December 2019. Applications were to be entered by 15th April 2020\r\rIt was later announced that the period covered by this measure was extended by a further two months, to cover up until the end of June. After this period some contributions will no longer be deferred. National Insurance, income tax and maternity contributions will need to be paid from 1 July. However, other taxes due by organisation have been deferred to the end of August. Companies can pay the deferred tax by May next year, with no interest charged.\r",

This measure should compensate losses caused to self-employed by anti-coronavirus measures.\r\rThe total amount of the support for one self-employed is CZK 44,500 (\u20ac1,660 approx.). The request for the compensation bonus has to be filled to the Tax Office up to 30 June 2020. The Tax Office should be disbursing this bonus without a delay and that solely by a cashless payment to the account of the self-employed.",

The self-employment has to be the main activity, however, in some cases it can be subsidiary activity (for example, for beneficiaries of disability or old-age pension or parental allowance). \r\rA statutory declaration should be also attached to the request, stating that the self-employed met the conditions for the compensation bonus and is not able to continue in business appropriately due to the health threats and/or government anti-crisis measures adopted with the occurrence of COVID-19.",

The employee will thus receive a sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency from the first day of his incapacity for work. This change was implemented by Act no. 63/2020 Coll, amending Act no. 461/2003 Coll on social insurance and Act no. 311/2001 Coll Labor Code",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to the local legal framework, in normal conditions the employee receives, during the first 10 days of incapacity to work, an income compensation directly from the employer. Only after 10 days, the employee receive a sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency. \rSelf-employed insured persons are, then, entitled to a sick benefit for the first three days of 25% and subsequently in the amount of 55% of the assessment base.\r\rOn the basis of the new COVID-19 related measure, the employer will not pay wage compensation in the case of employee's illness or if it is quarantined in reason of the epidemic, during the first 10 days of sick leave. Indeed, it will be paid by the Social Insurance Agency.\rSelf-employed as well receives full sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency from the first day of sick leave (i.e. not 25% during the first three days).\r\rThis measure is proposed in an effort to relieve the undertakings in times of crisis of costs related to temporary incapacity for work, as well as to increase the income of insured persons in cases of ordered quarantine measures and isolation.",

Beyond the current legal status, the sickness benefits will be paid to the persons concerned from the Social Insurance Agency for ten calendar days. The average assessment base of the person concerned is assumed to be at the level of the average wage of 2019, i.e. \u20ac1,092, as sickness benefits are basically based on the previous year's income. Expenditure on the basis of these assumptions is expected to be around \u20ac19.4 million in 2020.\r\rThe employers concerned are expected to achieve savings on compensation for temporary incapacity for work of about \u20ac169.4 on average per employee in quarantine measures, which is around \u20ac 16.9 million for the entire business sector (about 100,000 employees). Exact data on the total savings of employers are not available, because the Social Insurance Agency does not record data on the paid wage compensation or its amount (these data are not relevant for the performance of social insurance).\r\r",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to this COVID-19 related measure, the entitlement to the nursing benefit arises from the first day of the need for personal and full-time treatment of a close person and only expires on the day the need for his/her personal and full-day treatment ends (and not as previously, for a maximum of 10 days). The condition of receiving the nursing benefit is that the beneficiary treats a child under 16 years of age all day, whose health condition, as confirmed by the relevant doctor, necessarily requires treatment by another natural person. The benefit is also paid if the beneficiary cares for the child until the age of eleven (up to 18 years of age with long-term adverse health conditions), when the child has been ordered to quarantine or isolate. \r\rThe benefit shall also be paid if the pre-school or social care facility in which the child is being provided, or the school the child attends, has been closed by decision of the competent authorities or has been subject to a quarantine measure. Another case of eligibility arises when the insured person cares for a close relative, sibling, spouse, spouse or parent of the spouse if the social service facility in which such a person is provided with social services in an outpatient or residential form is as a result of a decision by the competent authorities concluded or quarantined.\r\rThe first estimations suggest that the nursing benefit for workers will correspond to an average daily amount of \u20ac15.8.",

The nursing benefit will be granted for all days during the closure of school and pre-school facilities, not only for 10 calendar days. Expenditure on the basis of these assumptions is expected to be around \u20ac 319.2 million in 2020. In April and May 2020, the Social Insurance Agency paid 230,262 benefits of \"pandemic nursing\" in the amount of \u20ac 62,218,391 (a year ago in 2019 it was only 29,608 benefits in the amount of \u20ac 3,259,123).",

These measures had, hence, a wide impact on some employers, that were totally or partially prevented from work. \r\rAs a partial relief, in order to diminish temporarily the labour-related expenditures (compulsory payments to the social insurance) of those employers, the government adopted the measure by Section 293ew of the amended Act on social insurance.",

The government can prolong the deadline. The Government Order (Nariadenie vlady 76/2020) allows more options for the determination of the revenue decrease: comparison with March 2019, February 2020 and 2019 monthly average. ",

The measure aims at protecting jobs and maintaining labour contracts in companies by supporting 2/3 of workers\u2019 wages.

The measure aims at protecting jobs and maintaining labour contracts in companies by supporting 2/3 of workers\u2019 wages. This measure adds the following main provisions: it forbids the companies that are entitled to the support to eliminate jobs (collective and individual redundancies); and establishes that the state budget will cover the financing of the part of wages provided by social security.\rThe Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 41/2020, of 6 June, that approved the Economic and Social Stabilization Program, extends the extraordinary support for the maintenance of employment contracts and establishes a transitional regime replacing the regime in force of \u2018simplified layoff\u2019 by a support to progressive recovery (2.2.). \r\rCompanies that remain closed as determined by the government continue to benefit from the simplified lay-off regime; the simplified lay-off, in the model currently in force, is extended until the end of July; companies that have a decrease in revenue equal to or greater than 40% may benefit, between August and December 2020, from a support mechanism for progressive recovery; companies that have benefited from the simplified lay-off regime can now benefit from an extraordinary incentive to normalize business activity, choosing one of two modalities: 1 minimum wage (635 euros) one-off or 2 minimum wages over 6 months. \r\rThe support for progressive recovery (2.2.1) introduces changes concerning the wages of workers under layoff (at the present a payment by 66%): workers will receive between 77% and 83% of their wages from August to September, and between 88% and 92%. from October to December 2020. The measure has two conditions: prohibition of dismissals during the application of the measure and in the subsequent 60 days; and prohibition of the distribution of dividends during the application of the measure.\r\rThe Resolution introduces also a one-off measure, the Stabilization Complement with the aim to improve the income of workers under layoff (2.3). The one-off measure, payable in July, in the amount of income loss of one month of lay-off, which can vary between 100\u20ac and 351\u20ac applies to all workers with an income, in February, up to 2 minimum wages and who have registered a loss of basic salary, and were in layoff in one of the months between April and June. Recipients: workers with a basic salary above 1 minimum wage and up to 2 minimum wages. \r\r\r",

In this connection, given the emergence of the need to care for a child in pre-school, pre-primary or primary education, as well as for a disabled person under 21 in general or special education, one of the parents is issued an electronic sick-leave certificate if the parents are not able to work remotely or their employer has not established idle time.",

Persons eligible for the benefit are parents, foster-parents, grandparents, caretakers and custodians who are entitled to the benefit, and are looking after child/children up to primary school age or child/children with disability under the age of 21. The benefit can be paid for up to 60 days. Payment of the benefit shall cease upon termination of the quarantine regime. Furthermore, following the declaration of the emergency situation and the suspension of the activities of day care centres for the disabled, sickness benefit is paid to those employees who have to care for a disabled person who has been previously attending a day care centre.",

These sectors are HORECA (catering), the tourism sector and the like. Businesses in these sectors will have accelerated access to partial unemployment from structural sources without limiting the number of employees affected.  Companies have the right to lay off a maximum of 25% of their employees until 31 December 2020. If a company succeeds in getting back to a good working order, it will have to give a priority of re-employment of the dismissed persons.\r\rFirms affected by the COVID-19 crisis, other than industrial firms and those in vulnerable sectors will also be able to have recourse to short-time working from structural sources through the fast-track procedure, provided they do not make redundancies. This measure aims to preserve jobs in the enterprises concerned as far as possible.\rIn this case, however, the number of employees covered by short-time working may not exceed 25% of the workforce for the months of July and August, 20% for the months of September and October and 15% for the months of November and December.\r\rFinally, applications from enterprises in vulnerable sectors making more than 25% of their workforce redundant, as well as those from all other enterprises wishing to make redundancies, will be required to submit a so-called \"traditional\" short-time working application.",

The measures can be divided into two main groups. The first set of measures are measures that are horizontal in nature and are aimed at maintaining the stability of the economy through the provision of stand-style arrangements and new liquidity. The second set of measures refers to sectoral measures that are both vertically and horizontally targeted with the aim of encouraging everyone to actively undertake activities aimed at preserving jobs, i.e. safeguarding employment. In this regard, 16 laws have been amended. Additional amendments to the General tax law have been adopted  on 7 April (OG 42/2020) ( see case number 288) and the new Ordinance on Amendments to the Ordinance on Implementation of the General Tax Law published on 8 April. (OG 43/2020).",

For companies that have revenue of more than HRK 7.5 million (\u20ac 1 million) and have a revenue drop of more than 50 -100%, taxes and social contributions will be proportionally written off over the next three months. \r\rTherefore, if a company has a revenue drop of 75%, it will pay 25% of taxes and contributions over the next three months. The companies that generate more than HRK 7.5 million (\u20ac 1 million), the 7% of big companies, will be exempt from their tax liabilities in proportion to the decrease in their revenue in April, May, and July. If their revenue has decreased by 20% to 50%, they are entitled to a deferral and interest-free payment in installments, those whose revenue has decreased by 50% to 100% will pay proportionately, and if their revenue has decreased by 75%, they will only pay 25% of their tax liabilities.

In order to avoid bankruptcies and a high share of unemployment, the Government decided to support the companies to pay wages to their employees. The measure was added to the Employment Programme 2017-2020 (programme through which additional active labour market measures are provided by the Unemployment Insurance Fund). It was discussed and approved by the Council of the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund and put into effect by a Government decree. The applications are accepted as of April 6 2020 until the end of July 2020.",

The employer is not able to provide at least 30% of their employees with work\r3. The employer has cut the wages of at least 30% of employees by at least 30% or down to the minimum wage.\r\rSubsidy is paid to employees who work on the basis of an employment contract and whose employers are not able to provide them with work or whose wages have been reduced. It must be applied for by the employer, but is paid directly to the employee.\r\rThe amount of the subsidy is 70% of the average monthly wage of the employee. The maximum amount of the subsidy is \u20ac1,000. The employment and social security taxes are also paid by the EUIF. The employer must pay additionally a wage of at least \u20ac150 to the employee (plus pay national taxes on the wage).\r\rThe subsidy is paid for up to two months for March, April or May 2020.",

On 17 March 2020, the Law No. XIII-2812 amending Article 88 of Law No. IX-2112 on Tax Administration of the Republic of Lithuania was adopted to increase the ability of taxpayers with temporary financial difficulties to stabilize their financial situation through deferral or arrangement of tax payment arrears.",

These taxpayers are subject to analogous measures to facilitate the payment of state social insurance contributions.

For business that were not active in the previous year, the basis of comparison will be the months proceeding March 2020. The Scheme is in accordance with Decree 131 of the Quarantine Law, Chapter 260 of the Ministry of Health.  \r\rOn Wednesday 8 April, the President of the Republic announced the decision of the Cabinet to extent the measure up until 12 June 2020. Currently, the Ministry of Labour undertakes a legal and technical processing of the measure. ",

Business participating, in addition, should not dismiss any employee during the participating period, during an additional month equal to the period of participation and plus one additional month. \r\rBusinesses up to 50 employees may join the Scheme by declaring the 75% of their total number of employees to receive the special unemployment benefit. Similarly, businesses employing more than 50 employees may declare  60% of their total number of employees. \r\rThe maximum amount for a period of a month may not exceed 1,214 euros. \r\rOn the 23 April 2020, the Cabinet amended the calculation of the payable amount to the beneficiaries in order to support as many employees as possible. The insurable earnings of the year 2018 will be taken into account, but in addition, a comparison will be made based on the declared salary of January 2020. The payable amount will be the highest amount that results from this comparison.  \r\rAdditionally, a minimum payable amount of \u20ac356 has been defined for beneficiaries. Also, a special plan will be implemented for employees who first started work in February and March 2020.\r \rAn additional amendment to the Scheme is the inclusion of persons over 65 years of age who do not receive statutory pension and continue to work. \r  \r \r\r\r ",

For suspending the interests on tax arrears, a government decree was changed and relevant subsection was added.",

Parents are\u00a0entitled to care allowance as\u00a0long as the ban on school attendance remains in force.\r\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The current phrasing of the Sickness Insurance Act provides care allowance for a period of nine calendar days to parents of children under the age of 10 who cannot be put in the care of a school / child-care facility; for single parents the care allowance is for a period of sixteen calendar days. Due to COVID-19 the Czech government decided\u00a0to raise the age limit for these children from 10 to 13 years of age and parents will be\u00a0entitled to care allowance as\u00a0long as the ban on school attendance remains. Those taking care of the disabled members of the family at home following the closure of day care centres are also to be entitled to the care allowance. \r\rAlso the self-employed are entitled to apply for the money.\u00a0The government has approved a financial contribution for the self-employed who are currently at home to ensure childcare. The state will pay 424 (\u20ac15,41) crowns per day, i.e. just under 14,000 (\u20ac510) crowns per month, to all self-employed persons taking care of children aged 6 to 13, on condition that a second member of the family no longer receives the care allowance.\r\rApplications are collected on-line.",

Therefore, on 20 March 2020, the Minister of Culture issued a Decision suspending the payment of the monument annuity for a period of two months (OG 37/2020). \rThis measure will cover around 100-120,000 companies, most of them being  very small and medium size companies, with around 200 thousand employees. \r",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Tourism is very sensitive to safety and health because if tourists do not feel safe, they do not travel. Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month. \r\rHowever, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.  ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by coronavirus is implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by awarding grants as a form of co-financing of wage costs. The Croatian Employment Service (CES) awards grants to an eligible employer in the amount of HRK 3.250,00 (\u20ac434) per month for full-time worker and HRK 1.625,00 (\u20ac217) per month for part-time worker. CES also awards a proportional part of the amount of HRK 3,250.00 or HRK 1,625.00 per worker for the time they did not work according to the decision of the Civil Protection Directorate. \r\rThe support can be provided to \r\r* employers in the following activities: providing accommodation and preparation and serving of food and drinks (Sector I), transportation and storage (Sector H) and health tourism; labour-intensive activities within the manufacturing industry like textiles, clothing, footwear, leather, wood and furniture; \r* employers who have been banned from performing their business activities by decisions of the Civil Protection Headquarters (national, county, local self-government units) and cannot carry out their activities, and \r* all other employers who can prove the adverse impact of special circumstances, if their income is reduced by more than 20%. \r\rSince 26 March 2020 all beneficiaries of grants for self-employment (owners and employees), employers who have been registered at the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute by 29 February 2020 and all workers employed until 29 February 2020 have also been included. \r\rThe support cannot be granted if there has been a decrease in the number of employees in the period from 20 March 2020 until the date of submission of the Grant Application, if the percentage of dismissal is greater than: \r\r* 40% for employers employing up to 10 workers; \r* 20% for small businesses;\r* 15%for medium-sized enterprises and \r* 10% for large companies. \r\rThe aforementioned amount of the grant - HRK 3,250 or HRK 1,625 per worker - is applied for March 2020, while for April and May 2020 it will be increased per worker monthly to HRK 4,000 (\u20ac534) for full-time job or HRK 2,625 (\u20ac267) for part-time job. The state will also cover also payment of social contributions, which amounts to HRK 1,460 (\u20ac194) for a net wage of HRK 4,000. In total, the state will pay HRK 5,460 (\u20ac728) per employee. \r\r ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "At the end of March,  around 65,000 employers with around 400,000 thousand workers were registered as users of the scheme at the CES.  At the end of April, the government has paid more than one and a half billion HRK (EURO 200 million) to preserve jobs for around 485,000 employees. Almost 84,000 employers have received support, including 145 large entrepreneurs.\rThe main criterion for assistance was a 20 percent drop in turnover. Leading recipients of the grants are big touristic company Valamar Riviera with more than 2,500 employees who have been paid more than eight million HRK (EURO 1.07 million) followed by Boxmark Leather with more than 2,000 employees, Mlinar with 1,737 employees, a car parts manufacturer from Solin AD Plastik with more than 1,500 employees. Of all beneficiaries of the grant 91,78% are micro firms with less than 10 employees, 6,99% are SME with less than 50 employees, 1.06% are medium employers with less than 250 employees, 0.03% are bigger employers with more than 250 employees.  \rAccording to the data of the Ministry of Labour and Pension System issued in May, the measures included about 550,000 employees. According to the same source, in March and April 2020 alone, the state allocated a total of around HRK 3.5 billion (\u20ac467 million) to measures to preserve jobs in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It is estimated that the measures in May 2020 costed the state treasury about HRK two billion (\u20ac267 million). Therefore, the state has spent around HRK 5.5 billion (\u20ac734 million) in three months of implementing measures to preserve employment in the coronary crisis.\r",

If the employer operates for less than 12 months, it is necessary to prove a decrease in turnover by at least 50% in May 2020 compared to February 2020 based on the submission of the VAT form for May and February 2020.\r\rHowever, CES has changed the conditions and methods of using funds for the implementation of active employment policy measures in 2020, and the most significant change is that the employer will have to repay support if it pays a dividend or profit share by the end of 2021.\r\rThis measure should cover up to 100,000 employees, or about 450,000 less than before. The calculations show, that it should be significantly cheaper for the state treasury, given that in June, as estimated in government circles, it would cost around HRK 400 million (\u20ac53 million).\r",

The measure is directed towards following sectors: transport and storage - primarily passenger transport by land; accommodation and food and beverage service activities; travel agencies, tour operators and other reservation services and related activities; creative, artistic and entertainment activities, entertainment and recreation activities and production and showing of films and video films; recording and distribution of sound recordings and distribution of music recordings. \rEligible employers are organizers of cultural, business and sporting events, organizers of fairs and weddings, and related activities such as equipment rental companies, audio and video recording, ticket sales, hall rental and other companies that generate most of their income from events and public gatherings. Therefore, eligible employers are commercial companies, crafts, family farms and natural persons who are self-employed and who are insured on that basis.\rEligible employees are those employed by employers from the target group of employers: all insured persons with the employer in question (regardless of whether the employment is a fixed-term or indefinite, whether they are citizens of Croatia, EU or third countries, full-time or part-time or have some status such as a single parent, a Croatian war veteran and a posted worker) and workers employed in representative offices. \rThe monthly amount of the support is HRK 4,000 (\u20ac533) per full-time employee, with the proportional part per employee according to the number of hours of part-time work and HRK 250 (\u20ac33) contribution for pension insurance based on mandatory individual capitalized saving (fully funded). \rEmployers need to prove that in June 2020 they had a decrease in turnover/revenue at least 60% compared to June 2019, based on the submission of the VAT form for June 2020 and June 2019 to the Tax Administration to receive support for July, and a 60% drop in July to receive support for August. Quarterly VAT payers have to prove a decrease in turnover/revenue of 60% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019. If the employer operates for less than 12 months, it is necessary for him or her to prove a decrease in turnover/revenue by at least 60% in June 2020 compared to February 2020 based on the submission of the VAT form for June and February 2020.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "A regulation of 'permanent seasonal work' was introduced in 2001. A fixed-term employment contract for a permanent seasonal job obliges employers to pay contributions for their seasonal workers throughout the year and obliges employers to offer their employees new employment contracts for the following season. According to the Act on Labour Market (OG 118/18) a permanent seasonal worker is entitled to financial assistance for a maximum of six months after termination of employment, and the employer is entitled to financial support from the Croatian Employment Service for financing contributions for extended pension insurance. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Parliament accepted the Law on Amendments to the Act on Labour Market (OG 32/20) which  prescribes the authority of the Governing Board of the Croatian Employment Service in the case of special circumstances to decide on: \r\r* prolongation of the entitlement to financial assistance for permanent seasonal workers; and \r* to enable the employer co-financing the costs of the extended pension insurance. \r\rCurrently, the Governing Board of the Croatian Employment Service has not decided about the mentioned changes. During extended insurance, the worker receives 100% of the minimum wage in the first 3 months (gross monthly wage in 2020 is HRK 4,062.51 or \u20ac 541,67), and in the next 3 months 50% of the minimum wage.

The provision is found in the Decree 107 of the Quarantine Law, Chapter 260 issued on the Thursday 19 March 2020 by the Minister of Health for the protection of public health and the health care system.  \r\rOn Wednesday 8 April, the President of the Republic announced the decision of the Cabinet to extent all the measures taken by the Degrees of the Minister of Health up until 30 April 2020. The Minister of Health undertakes, currently, a legal and technical processing of these measures.  ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure provides the requisition of all doctors and nurses, registered in the Medical Record and the Nurse Record, accordingly, during the starting day of the implementation of the Degree. According to the Decree, all doctors and nurses are under the instructions of the Minister of Health and carry out the tasks assigned to them during the implementation period. \r\rThe names of the commanded doctors and nurses will be posted on the website of the Ministry of Health and will be informed by other means as well that the Minister will decide. \r\rDoctors and nurses in the vulnerable groups, as defined by the Ministry, will carry out other duties of the Ministry of Health or will be excluded from duties according to the judgment of the Minister.

According to the the Health Statistics of the Statistical Services of Cyprus (2017), the number of doctors working in private and public hospitals is 3,388 and the number of nurses in private and public hospitals is 3,387. The number of registered health professionals in their respective health associations, however, might be higher but it was impossible to communicate and confirm it with the associations probably due to restrictions of movement for the prevention of the spread of the virus.

Similarly, trainers, athletes, masseurs, physical therapists, whose activities have been suspended during the state of emergency, at the initiative of the sports organisation, shall  benefit from an indemnity of 75% of their monetary rights, within the same threshold applicable to employees (maximum 75% of RON 5,429 RON (\u20ac1,100).

However, most of the self employed are not eligible for the indemnity provided by the state - most of the self-employed are not legally registered as such, others don't fulfill the legal criteria. By now, it is difficult to estimate the number of beneficiaries of this measure, but most probably it will not exceed 100,000. ",

The loss of wage and no sickness benefit for the first three days make the situation very difficult for some people. For this, it was necessary to approve the supplementary state budget by the Parliament, which was done on 15 April 2020.",

When the supplementary state budget is approved, the EHIF will compensate those days to all employees irrespective of the reason of the sick leave (i.e. in addition to corona virus, the person can have other disease or injury in order to receive compensation). As usual, the days 4-8 will be compensated by the employer, and then continued by the EHIF.

The length of debt moratorium depends on the borrower. During the deferment period, individual borrowers will be fully relieved of debt service obligations whereas corporate borrowers will continue to pay interest and fees but enjoy a holiday on scheduled principal instalments for the duration of the deferment. \r\rHowever, before this act was approved, many banks have introduced their own conditions under which the borrower can ask for the postponement of repayments.

Applicants have to ask for the payment postponement at the bank and declare that their situation is caused by anti-virus measures (unemployment, quarantine, decrease in business activity).

The debt moratorium does not apply to credit cards, overdrafts, revolving loans, operating leases or loans related to capital market transactions. Repayments cannot be deferred for loans where the debtor has been late in repayment for over 30 days as of 26 March 2020.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The measure was introduced due to the strong increase in requests for temporary unemployment (which normally can only be implemented under certain conditions). The measure alleviates pressure on the institutions that are tasked with organizing and distributing unemployment benefits, both the National Employment Office (NEO) and the trade unions (that also play an important role in paying out the unemployment benefits). The use of temporary unemployment means that the employers no longer have to pay the wages of their employees (the cost is transferred to the government through the unemployment benefit), thereby enabling them to reduce their costs and enhances their ability to better cope with the period of inactivity of the business.\r\rThe measures makes the procedure shorter and more simplified for employees in order to make sure that they receive their unemployment benefit as fast as possible.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "From 13 March 2020, the notion of temporary unemployment due to force majeure will be flexibly applied by the NEO. All situations of temporary unemployment due to the corona virus can be considered as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even if, for example, it is still possible to work on certain days.\r\rFor the duration of the restrictive measures (currently until 31 May 2020), the employer is no longer obliged to send notices of temporary unemployment for reasons of force majeure to the competent unemployment office of the NEO. The period may be extended until 30 June 2020 if the public health measures are extended or strengthened by the government.\r\rThe employee may use a simplified form to submit the application for benefits to the designated payment institution.\r\rFrom 01 February 2020 until 30 June 2020, the employee receives a benefit equal to 70% of his average capped salary (capped at \u20ac2,754.76 per month). \r\rThe employee who is made temporarily unemployed due to force majeure (reason \"coronavirus\") will receive a supplement of \u20ac5.63 per day on top of the unemployment benefit, from the NEO. A withholding tax on professional income of 26.75% is deducted from the benefit. \r",

The purpose of this measure is to help persons to overcome their lower income during quarantine. A further goal is to contain the costs for employers which might have to pay wage compensation to the employees on a sick leave for not quarantine-related reasons.",

The physician sends the form to the Social Insurance Agency. The sick person also must inform his or her employer about the quarantine. There have been differences from the regular sickness benefit applied in other reasons than COVID-19. In these other cases, the first ten days of sick leave are paid by the employer as a wage compensation (25% of gross wage during first three days and 55% of gross wage from the fourth to the 10th day). The sickness benefit is paid by the Social Insurance Agency from the 11th day of the sickness (55% of gross wage).\rNot all persons in obligatory quarantine with COVID-19 are eligible for this benefit. They have to have paid sickness benefit insurance at least 270 days in the course of two years before the sickness - same as in other cases.\r",

The exact number of quarantine sickness benefits applications due to COVID-19 is not available. It is assumed that the vast majority of these applications refers, anyway, to COVID-19 quarantine as there were only 10 quarantine sickness benefits in March 2019. In April 2020 there were 6,451 quarantine sickness benefits applications compared to seven in April 2019. Finally, 4,065 persons applied for quarantine sickness benefit in May 2020, compared to 13 in May 2019. \rIn April 2020 the Social Insurance Agency paid out almost half of March 2020 quarantine sickness benefits.",

Therefore, additional public funding will be made available for usage by public venture capital investors, such as the KfW Capital, the High-Tech Gr\u00fcnderfonds or the European Investment Fund. The general idea is that public venture capital investors will use the additional funds to fill-in for other investors that might pull out during the crisis.

Around 25% of persons active in the sector are self-employed or independent artists, without adequate institutional support, so for them the situation is very challenging. Furthermore, there are many single-person owned companies which are also very vulnerable in the current situation. An appeal to government  and local authorities for urgent assistance was launched on 15 March by the Independent theater producers, authors and performers, and the Association of Concert Promoters and signed by  more that 1,300 persons, most of whom are freelancers or independent authors in the sector.\r\r\r",

The government is preparing a proposal for measures for entrepreneurs who will be able to prove the losses incurred in the context of the epidemic. Given the diversity of artistic fields, the Ministry of Culture calls on all professional associations and representatives of the independent cultural sector, in times of crisis identified as particularly fragile, to submit impact assessments so that the proposed measure is as accurate as possible and adapted to all segments of the independent cultural sector and their creators. Around 1,000 people are believed to request financial support from the Ministry. ",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The retail trade is one of the most competitive and most dynamic branches of the Croatian economy. Of the total number of employees in commerce (around 260,000), the majority are employed in retail (around 50%), followed by wholesale trade (40%). Around 80% of employees have an open-ended contract, while only a small minority (around 3%) work part-time. Croatian commerce tried to respond as effectively and efficiently as possible to the wishes and needs of its customers. However, in current situation, employees are particularly vulnerable to infection due to permanent contacts with the customers and many over-time working hours due to the serious shortages of the labour force. \r\rAs a mean to prevent the mingling, reduce possibilities for spreading of virus and possibilities to stipulate working hours, the Law on Amendments to the Trade Act (OG 32/20) defines following: Special circumstances \"means an event or a condition which could not be predicted and could not be affected, which threatens the life and health of citizens, property of high value, significantly damages the environment, disrupts economic activity or causes significant economic damage\". ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Act also empowered the Civil Protection Authority of the Republic of Croatia to determine working hours in trade activities in special circumstances. Indirectly related to the Act, many retail chains in Croatia increased salaries and bonuses and paid out an Easter supplement for their workers in the hope to retain current working force and attract new workers. They also accepted various security measures and equipment to protect their employees from the corona virus. They installed Plexiglas barriers at all cash registers, and have provided security visors to employees at self-service cash register. \r\rWith the intention to minimize exposure and reduce the risk of corona virus infection, the Civil Protection Authority of the Republic of Croatia determine that only shops with food and some other special stores would be opened. Working hours in trade activities are defined from 8 am until 5 pm. ",

As it is hard to find new work for solo self-employed and free lancers and many of their jobs are cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Government opened up the basic income scheme. The new scheme also includes groups that are not truly looking for a new job, but are only temporarily out of business, such as solo self-employed. Applicants for basic income support working as solo self-employed will not have to make any statements on their financial assets and will also not have to tap these assets within the next six months, before being granted basic income support. With the basic income support, they should be able to pay rent or finance their housing. The new rules also provide that application will be provisionally approved and the usual means-testing will be conducted later. In this way, the government hopes to facilitate easier and faster access to these grants.",

Moreover, it introduces a new support instrument (Cassa Integrazione in Deroga, CID) which benefits all companies with even one employee, and it simplifies the procedures for activating this measure.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Employers who suspend or reduce their activity for events attributable to the COVID-19 epidemic can accede to the Ordinary Wage Guarantee Fund (CIGO) or the Wage Integration Fund (FIS) for a maximum duration of nine weeks starting from 23 February 2020 until the end of August 2020. The periods of utilisation of the CIGO and the FIS for \"COVID-19\" reasons are excluded from the calculation of the maximum duration of ordinary treatments. Moreover, companies making use of the benefit are exempted from the additional contribution that is normally imposed on companies benefiting from wage subsidies. The decree law introduces a special measure (CID) for private employers not covered by the ordinary benefits, i.e. those employing less than 5 employees. However, domestic workers are excluded from the benefit.\rThe amount of the benefit depends on the previous remuneration: for gross monthly wages below \u20ac2,159.48, the benefit amounts to \u20ac939.89; for gross monthly wages above \u20ac2,159.48, the benefit amounts to \u20ac1,129.48.\rThe maximum spending limit is set at \u20ac1,347.2 million (for CIGO and FIS) and \u20ac3,293.2 million (CID), for the year 2020; once reached, INPS will not consider further requests.",

After 30 days, the state of emergency was prolonged with another 30 days, till 15 May 2020 - during all this period, the schools remain suspended. This situation left a lot of employees without any immediate solutions to ensure their children supervision and care. To  respond to this problem, the Romanian Parliament passed a law (Law no. 19/2020) requiring employers (both in the public and the private sector) to grant paid leave to one of the parents if schools are closed due to \u201cextreme situations\u201d. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to the law 19/2020 , employers must grant employees paid leave if schools are closed in exceptional circumstances, but only if the tasks associated with the employees\u2019 roles cannot be performed in \u201cworking from home\u201d or teleworking conditions. Paid leave can be granted to only one of the parents, and only if the child in care is of maximum 12 years of age (or 18 years of age for children with a disability), who are formally registered as attending courses in a school. \r\rIn some sectors, the parent's request for leave is conditioned by the employer's acceptance (national energy system units, operating units in the nuclear sectors, continuous fire units, health and social care units, telecommunications, public radio and television, rail transport, units that ensure the public transport and sanitation of the localities, as well as the supply of the population with gas, electricity, heat, and water). During such leave, employees will be entitled to a payment of up to 75% of the employee\u2019s base salary, but not more than 75% of the average gross salary in the economy. The allowance is subject to personal income tax and social security contributions (i.e. personal income tax, social security contribution, health insurance contribution and work insurance contribution). \r\rThe net value of the allowance paid by the employer (the amount actually received by the parent) can be recovered from the Guarantee Fund for the payment of salary claims; the corresponding personal income tax and the social security contributions are borne by the employer. To recover the net allowance, employers should submit a request to the local or the Bucharest unemployment agency. ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "These applies to all employees with children in care. There is no estimation yet regarding the number of parents/employers that made use of the legal provision. ",

In face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the collective bargaining partners interrupted the ongoing bargaining round and settled an agreement aimed at supporting the companies and workers in getting through the crisis by an extensive use of short time work.\r\rThe so-called 'Solidarity collective agreement' was first concluded by the collective bargaining partners in North-Rhine Westfalia and subsequently copied by the partners in all other regions.\r\rIt is noteworthy that the collective bargaining partners build on experiences in the economic crisis 2009/2010 when they also cooperated in campaigning against direct dismissals and for short time working.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The agreement settles: \r\r* that annual bonus payment shall be cut in twelve and used for raising the short time working allowance from 60% of the net monthly wage (standard) to 80% of the net monthly wage; \r* in case an annual bonus payment is not in place, a solidarity fund shall be established and the employer shall pay \u20ac350 per full-time equivalent into this solidarity funds. The funds shall be used for workers facing particular hardships. In case the money is not used up by the end of the year, it shall be distributed to the workers;\r* parents with children up to twelve years get five extra days of care leave. Also, they may choose between the annual bonus payment (resp. the extra on the short time allowance) or extra days of leave. \r\rWage negotiations are postponed until the end of the pandemic",

The benefit will be paid directly from the National Social Security Institute (INPS) and aims at supporting income of those workers which are not eligible for other income support measures such as the different wage guarantee funds.\rAlways through the Decree Law No. 18/2020, Article 44, the Government allocates further \u20ac300 million for income support of professionals registered to private social security agencies and self-employed and employees not covered by any other analogous measure.",

In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government adopted a \u2018temporary lay-off scheme\u2019 and reimbursement of wage compensations to workers who cannot work due to force majeure. The measure addresses laid-off workers for whom company temporary fails to provide work and workers who cannot work due to force majeure:\r \r* workers in quarantine, who cannot work from home; \r* workers who look after children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; \r* workers who cannot come to work on the grounds of the suspension of public transport or ban on the border crossing.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to the Employment Relationship Act, when a company temporarily fails to provide work for business reasons (in the event of a temporary layoff), the worker is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of 80% of the wage basis. The wage basis is determined at the worker\u2019s average monthly wage for full-time work during the past three months. On the other hand, if a worker cannot carry out his work due to force majeure, he is entitled to half of the payment he would have received if he was working, but not less than 70% of the minimum wage. The temporary laid-off worker is obliged to respond to the employer\u2019s invitation in a manner and under the conditions laid down in the lay-off letter (Employment Relationship Act, Articles 137, 138). \rThe measure being examined, attempting to cushion the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, grants the employers with 80% reimbursement of the sums payed to provide the economic treatment mentioned above to workers (in case of temporary lay-off as well as force majeure). This reimbursement is funded with the state budget. Reimbursement is limited to the average monthly salary in 2019 and cannot be lower than the minimum wage (it is thus higher than statutory determined compensations). \rThe maximum length of receiving compensation is from 13 March to 31 May.\rTo be eligible for the reimbursements, a company had to demonstrate a 20% lower income in the first half of 2020 and 50% lower income in the second half of 2020, compared to 2019.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Companies that are not eligible are: \r\r* State institutions. \r* Financial and insurance companies with more than 10 employees. \r* Companies having outstanding debt with the Financial Administration. \r* Foreign or international organisations (not including humanitarian and disability organisations).\r\rThe Employment Service of Slovenia administers employers\u2019 requests for compensations. Up to 31 May, the Employment Service received requests for wage compensation for 275,317 employees and additional 54,168 since 1 June.\rIn first reactions, employers protested against the rule requesting 20% lower incomes. They said that it would exclude many companies from the support mechanism (Mekina, 2020). The government agreed to employer organisations and lowered the threshold to 10% in the second COVID-19 law ZIUZEOP-A, issued on 30 April 2020. ",

Their proposal was not integrated into the first COVID-19 law, issued on 10 April 2020.\rTwo cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stressed that the emergency measure left out the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed (\u0160u\u010dur, 2020).\r\rThe second COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP-A from 30 April 2020) finally adopted their proposals: it extended the referential period as well as the group of eligible persons (besides full-time also part-time self-employed).\r",
            "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. Its functioning was blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council. On 20 April, trade unions protested against the exclusion of social partners in the preparation of the second emergency law (ZIUZEOP-A).

While referential period for companies was one year, it was one month (February) for self-employed. NGOs said that this rule exclude many self-employed persons, since they receive their fees irregularly and many may have had no money inflows in February. Their proposal was not integrated into the first COVID-19 law, issued on 10 April 2020. \r\rTwo cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the income income and for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stressed that the emergency measure left out the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed (\u0160u\u010dur, 2020).\r\rThe second COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP-A from 30 April 2020) adopted their proposals: it extended the referential period as well as the group of eligible persons (besides full-time also part-time self-employed).",

These measures are new and exceptional, and aimed at extending the COVID-19 quarantine periods with some legal instruments already into force for normal sick-leaves.\r\rThe measures for workers of the private sector have been introduced with the Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 (art. 26).

The costs for this measure are financed by the State and not by the National Social Security Institute or the employers. \r\rFor workers in the public sector, according to this measure, the period spent in quarantine with active surveillance is equalised to hospitalisation. In this way, the quarantined civil servants are not subject to the deduction set by Article 71 of Law No. 133/2008, that in normal conditions allow them to get an indemnity calculated only on their basic monthly wage, excluding all the additional treatments.",

The legal reference of this measure is Article 43, paragraph 1, of the Law Decree No. 18 of 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The joint protocol aims to ensure the protection of workers' health and the necessary safety conditions in all workplaces. In particular, the agreement provides that the continuation of production activities can take place only on condition that adequate levels of protection are guaranteed to workers. To facilitate the containment of the virus, the agreement allows to suspend or temporary reduce the activity, or to adopt the telework (smart working) scheme as much as possible. The agreement also indicates specific containment measures that follow anti-contagion safety protocols (interpersonal distance between workers or adoption of safety devices). Among these measures are:\r\r1. The use of smart and remote working schemes for the activities that can be carried out at home or remotely. \r2. Encouraging the use of paid leave also through collective agreements. \r3. The suspension of the activities of company departments not indispensable for production. \r4. The adoption of anti-contagion safety protocols, the respect of the interpersonal distance of one meter as main measure of containment, the adoption of individual protection tools (e.g. masks and hand sanitizers). \r5. The sanitisation of workplaces and common areas. \r6. Limiting to the minimum essential the movement of people inside production sites. \r7. Encouraging the negotiation of specific collective agreements for the companies that are still in production. \r8. The establishment of a company committee with the participation of employees' workplace representatives for monitoring the application of the protocol. \r\rThe protocol was renegotiated and revised on 24 April 2020 and attached to the Decree of the Prime Ministry of 26 April 2020. The main amendments concerned the following issues: \r\r* The non-application of the Protocol - which results in the inability to guarantee adequate levels of protection - determines the suspension of the activity until conditions of safety are restored.\r* The supervision of the client company about the compliance with the provisions also with regard to the staff of third-party companies operating in the client's premises/construction sites.\r* Attention to the means of transport to reach the workplace.\r\rFurthermore, the \u20ac50 million allocated by the Government to undertakings to implement the agreement will be distributed, upon request, by the National Agency for inward investment promotion and enterprise development (INVITALIA). These funds might me employed also to reconvert the production of the companies to healthcare instruments.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Link to case FR-2020-10/217\r\rThe short-time working (activit\u00e9 partielle /partial activity or ch\u00f4mage partiel /partial unemployment) is a tool at the service of the public policy of prevention of economic layoffs, which allows the employer in difficulty to have all or part of the cost of the remuneration of his employees covered. \rThis system is an old one and is in general reactivated in times of crisis, as happened also in 2008. \rIt is governed by Articles L. 5122-1 et seq. and R. 5122-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code. In the context of the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the system was relaxed.The partial activity is intended for all employees who suffer a reduction in remuneration attributable to :\r- either a reduction in the working hours practiced in the establishment or part of the establishment below the legal working hours (35 hours);\r- a temporary closure of all or part of the establishment.\r\rRequests for partial activity are made by employers if the drop in activity is caused by one of the reasons referred to in Article R. 5122-1 of the Labour Code, including circumstances of an exceptional nature, which apply in the present crisis.\r\rDuring the period of partial activity :\r- The employer receives from the public authorities (Services and Payment Agency - ASP) an allowance equivalent to a share of the hourly pay of the employee placed in partial activity;\r- The employee receives a partial activity allowance from the employer in lieu of salary for the period during which the employee is placed in partial activity.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The short-time working scheme cover all employees of the private sector. \rWith the new provisions adopted to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the partial activity allowance paid by the State to the company - co-financed by the State and by the joint body that manages the unemployment insurance scheme (Un\u00e9dic) - is no longer a lump sum, but is proportional to the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity. \rThe 'remainder payable' by the employer, i.e. the amount of the remuneration which the employer must pay to the employee, is zero for all employees whose remuneration is less than 4.5 gross SMIC (\u20ac45.68 per hour or \u20ac6,927.39 per month).\rThe compensation due to the employee covers at least 70% of his previous gross remuneration, i.e. approximately 84% of the net salary.\r\rThere is nothing to prevent an employer from compensating its employees in excess of 70% of gross salary if it can/wishes to do so or if a collective or company-level agreement so provides.\r\rIn all cases, a minimum of \u20ac8.03 per hour is respected.\r\rSpecific measures are planned for employees of private employers (cleaning ladies) and childcare assistants (who look after young children) who are usually paid by the hour with a job voucher system.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of April 7, 2020, 692,000 applications for partial activity have been filed. They concern 669,000 establishments and 6,300,000 employees (2.3 million more than on 31 March).  About 59% of employees who have applied for partial activity since 1 March work in establishments with fewer than 50 employees. These establishments account for 34% of private salaried employment. Conversely, those working in establishments with more than 250 employees account for 15% of employees in partial activity, while these establishments account for 20% of private salaried employment.\rThe Ministry of Labour (DARES and DGEFP) and the public employment service P\u00f4le Emploi have decided to update these data every weeks.

The agreement reached between the two Chambers on 02 June, which has yet to be formally adopted, empowers the Government to further adapt the short time working scheme to take account of the needs of a gradual recovery and to create a special provision for companies permanently affected by the crisis although not likely to fail.\rNew short time working provision based on collective bargaining and \u2018quid pro quos\u2019. A new mechanism that provides long-term support for companies in return for a set of commitments, particularly in terms of maintaining employment, is thus being planned. Both the level of compensation for employees whose activity is reduced and the level of State reimbursement have yet to be established by decree, but the idea is to increase the State element if the company, that has had to make recourse short time working to persevere through the crisis, negotiates or enters into a collective sector agreement, which not only defines the terms of the short time working, but also provides for company commitment in return, and in particular in terms of maintaining employment. This mechanism, known as \u2018short time working to maintain employment\u2019, is aimed at \u2018companies faced with a lasting reduction in activity and whose survival is not compromised\u2019, under a set of certain conditions and cases that are still to be determined. The agreement and documents implementing the sector agreement with this framework will have to be approved by the labor administration.\rShort time working to be adapted from 01 June for six months to facilitate the recovery. The extraordinary short time working scheme was initially set up amid the health crisis, and has been amended several times. It may be amended once more in order to adapt it to the economic recovery and the situation of certain sectors and employees. Once adopted, the bill authorized the government to issue a new ordinance to adapt short time working rules \u2018to the specificities of the companies according to the economic impact of the health crisis, their sector of activity and the categories of employees concerned (...).'\rMonetizing leave periods. The text also allows a collective agreement to allow for employees who have suffered a reduction in their remuneration due to being placed on short time working, to voluntarily supplement their income by monetizing rest days or paid holidays, for up to a maximum of 5 days The agreed text also provides that employees under short time working conditions must also benefit from the maintenance of their collective guarantees and that, as an exception, the periods between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020, during which contributing workers received the short time working allowances, would be taken into account for the purposes of enabling the right to a retirement pension. \rPlanet Labor, 03 June 2020, No.11981 \u2013 www.planetlabor.com",

In addition, former civil servants are recruited voluntarily for full-time positions (at least 40 hours per week, overtime can be added) from May or June 2020 for a duration of two to three months.\r\rWhile regular civil servants who have been mandatorily extended receive their regular remuneration (\u20ac346.70) plus supplement of  \u20ac189.90 (tax free), the newly recruited voluntary former civil servants receive in addition to this a flat-rate compensation of almost \u20ac1,300 (gross).

However, as agriculture is one of the supply-critical sectors in the current COVID-19 crisis, many seasonal workers, for some of whom employment permits have already been issued, are unable to enter Austria due to travel restrictions and cannot start work as planned.

The regulation basically states that persons entering Austria from one of these countries must carry a medical certificate (in German, English, Italian or French) on their state of health and show that the molecular biological test for SARS-CoV-2 is negative. The medical certificate must not be more than four days old at the time of entry. Persons who are unable to present such a certificate shall be refused entry.

Teleworking is a right provided for in Article L. 1222-9 of the Labour Code, resulting from the Order of 22 September 2017, and must be favoured in phase 3 of the epidemic. An employee can therefore ask his employer to benefit from telework until further notice. The employer may refuse, but reasons must be given for the refusal.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Since the passage to stage 3 of the epidemic, the implementation of telework must be imperative as soon as the workstation allows it. Telework can be implemented when the workstation layout is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity and to guarantee the protection of employees.\r\rArticle L. 1222-11 of the Labour Code mentions the risk of an epidemic as a possible justification for the use of telework without the employee's agreement. The implementation of telework in this context does not require any particular formalism.\r\rIn a circular, the ministry of Labour estimate the employee must receive an allowance intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework: 'In the context of the current health crisis \u2013 since telework is carried out, in the majority of cases, over the entire actual working time and is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity, to guarantee the protection of employees and for reasons of public health \u2013 it should be considered that the employer is obliged to pay his employee a telework allowance, intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework'. Indeed, the employer has an obligation to bear the professional expenses. This obligation is provided for without restriction by the case-law, which is of general application and must cover teleworkers.\r\r'However, adds the ministry of Labour, in view of the difficulty of identifying and circumscribing the expenses relating to the professional activity and those relating to personal life, it is in the employer's interest to favour a lump sum which will simplify its management'.\r\rIf the allowance paid by the employer is a lump sum, it will then be deemed to be used in accordance with its purpose and will be exempt from social security contributions up to an overall limit of \u20ac10/month for an employee who teleworks one day per week. This exempt lump-sum allowance increases to \u20ac20/month for an employee teleworking two days a week, \u20ac30/month for 3 days a week, etc.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In 2017, about 3.0% of employees were teleworking at least once a week. According to an INSEE economic report published on 26 March 2020, i.e. ten days after the start of confinement, approximately one third of employees are working at their usual place of work, one third are teleworking and the last third are on short-time working. On 15 March, in a press release, the Ministry of Labour estimates that close to 8 million jobs (or more than four out of ten jobs) are compatible with telework in the private sector.",

The measure aims at protecting companies from bankruptcies due to negative consequences of the epidemic. The management can abstain from the duty to start the compulsory settlement or bankruptcy until 31 August if the company became insolvent because of the epidemic. When a creditor files for a bankruptcy proceeding over a debtor, the debtor will have 4 months instead of current 2 months for financial restructuring to prevent bankruptcy. Extensions will be applicable to bankruptcy proceedings, filed for by creditors until 31 August 2020. Other changes tackle compensation of unpaid wages from the Guarantee Fund, personal bankruptcy procedures, and enforcement proceedings.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Deferred compulsory settlement or bankruptcy means that management is not obliged to start this procedure during the period of epidemic and the three succeeding months (until 31 August). The management can abstain from the duty if the company becomes insolvent due to the state, ministry or local authority\u2019s ban on production or trade or if company was solvent on 31 December 2020.\r \rOn the other hand, the law reinforces some workers\u2019 rights. Workers can have easier access to reimbursements of the Public Scholarship, Development, Disability and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (Guarantee Fund) for unpaid wages in the last three months, unpaid sick leave, annual leave and severance payment. Employees are entitled to compensation from the Guarantee Fund if they filed for a bankruptcy proceeding. This rule is valid until 30 June 2020. From July 2020, workers again needs court\u2019s final decision in a bankruptcy proceeding to get access to the Guarantee Fund. Employees may have also easier access to the Guarantee Fund if they have not received wage compensations one month from the time the state paid reimbursements to their employers. In these cases, the employer is presumed no longer solvent (presumption is valid until September 2020) and employees may file for a bankruptcy proceeding. If they do so, they are exempt from paying the advance for costs of a bankruptcy proceeding. \r\rAs for personal bankruptcy and enforcement, the law stipulates that payments under emergency laws are not the object of personal bankruptcy and enforcement. Exceptions are made for wage compensation. \r\rFinally, during the COVID-19 epidemic the enforcement proceedings are temporarily suspended. Exemptions are enforcement based on a claim for legal alimony and other urgent matters, determined by the court.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Emergency regulation on insolvency curbs the risks of bankruptcies on the one hand, while protects the interests of workers on the other. The exemption of payments under emergency regulation from bankruptcy estate protects persons in the personal bankruptcy procedure.",

Its functioning was blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council. On 20 April, trade unions protested against the exclusion of social partners in the preparation of the second emergency law (ZIUZEOP-A). They demanded the reactivation of the Economic and Social Council. The first meeting of the Economic and Social Council was held not before 15 May 2020. The Council then became involved in negotiations about the third emergency law ZIUOOPE, issued on 30 May 2020",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The \u2018Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act (ZIUZEOP)\u2019 modified the already amended \u2018Agricultural Act\u2019, adopted on 24 April 2018, which created a new legal form of labour, the so-called temporary work in agriculture. \r\rAs an exception from the labour law, temporary work in agriculture does not fall under the general prohibition on work based on civil contract, if there are elements of the employment relationship. It is thus covered by a limited set of labour rights, like the ban on discrimination and harassment, the interdiction of child work, rules on working time, breaks, and rest periods, the prohibition of work for some specific groups. The Agricultural Act explicitly mentions viticulture, fruit growing, hop growing, and vegetable growing as sectors much in need of such unprotected and occasional labour force.\r\rThe 2020 provisions lifting restrictions to the utilization of temporary work in agriculture have been introduced to put a remedy to the shortage of immigrant workers in the agricultural sector, due to the limitations to cross-border movements caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure responds to the concern of some agricultural sectors which, after the ban on border crossing relating to the COVID-19 epidemic, remained without seasonal migrant workers. \rBy rule, \u2018temporary work in agriculture\u2019 is limited to 120 days a year. \rThe emergency regulation suspend this limitation until the end of 2020. It means that such type of work can be carried out without restriction all year. \rThe emergency regulation also stipulates that Public Employment Service may assign temporary work in agriculture to temporary laid-off persons. \rUpon the request of agricultural enterprise, the Public Employment Service sends to work a person who is temporary laid-off due to the epidemic",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Hop growers report on troubles due to labour shortage after the ban on the border crossing. They say that the sector relies on Rumanian seasonal agricultural workers who are no more allowed to come. Goran Luki\u010d from the Counselling Office for Workers commented that better pay and labour protections would help to make agricultural work more attractive to the Slovene population.",

These derogations from the Labour Code have been adopted through the Ordonnance No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, and can be implemented until 31 December 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In order to deal with the economic, financial and social consequences of the spread of COVID-19, the Ordinance provides that a collective company agreement or, failing that, a branch agreement, may:\r\u25cf Authorise the employer to impose the taking of paid leave, up to a limit of 6 days (i.e. 1 week's paid leave). In this case, the employer must respect a period of notice of at least 1 clear day (as against 1 month in normal times). This provision covers both acquired leave and leave in the process of being acquired (i.e. it may be taken even before the start of the leave period).\u25cf Authorize the employer to unilaterally modify the dates of taking paid leave up to a limit of 6 days. This provision relates to paid leave already taken by the employee. The employer must respect a notice period of at least 1 clear day (compared to one month in normal times). In the absence of a collective agreement, the law already allows the employer to do so without observing the one month's notice period, in exceptional circumstances as is currently the case.\u25cf Authorise the employer to impose the splitting of the main leave when it exceeds 12 days, without the employee's agreement.\rApart from the derogations from the rules on paid leave set out above, which imply a collective agreement, the employer may impose (without the need for a collective agreement) or modify the taking of the other rest days (provided for in a collective agreement on the reduction of working time, provided for in an agreement on the organisation of working time or provided for in a lump-sum-day agreement which exists for employees whose actual working time cannot be determined). In addition, the employer may impose the taking of rest days placed in a time-saving account.\rThe Ordinance provides for two limits: \r1. The employer must give the employee one day's notice. \r2. Derogations may concern a maximum of 10 rest days by 31 December 2020.\rThe employer, additionally, may set the dates of leave without taking into account the simultaneous leave entitlements of spouses employed in the same company. The employer may dissociate their leaves if the presence of only one of the two spouses is indispensable to the company, or if one of them has already exhausted his or her paid leave (normally the Labour Code provides that spouses or partners who are employees of the same company are entitled to simultaneous leave).\r\rFinally, the ordinance allows the employer (without collective agreement) to derogate to the Sunday rest. He is allowed to ask employees to work on Sunday. These derogations do not apply to all undertakings, however. They concern firms in sectors deemed essential to the continuity of economic life and national security (the list of which will be laid down by decree) and firms which provide the above mentioned with services necessary for the performance of their main activity. Provisions also apply to companies located in the departments of LaMoselle, Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin, which were hard hit by the Covid crisis.",

The new amendment gives a legal right to an unemployed person to receive unemployment benefits from the state and at the same time work at a rural stop and take a salary from there.\r\rAccording to unofficial information, the Ministry of Agriculture is also discussing the possibility of workers in enterprises that have been introduced to reduced working hours due to the coronavirus crisis and are being compensated under the 60/40 scheme, to be able to start additional work in agriculture",

Those who are currently on unpaid leave can also sign a second employment contract without permission from their primary employer. These are the two approved measures that, at the threshold of the active season in agriculture, should divert employees to this sector.\r\rAmendments to the Emergency Legislation adopted in April 2020 introduce the possibility for farmers to conclude temporary employment contracts similar to one-day contracts to hire employees for activities such as harvesting. The key change in this case is that the conclusion of such contracts would not affect the receipt of unemployment benefits or social benefits by employees, which in previous years was a serious obstacle to securing seasonal workers on the field.\r\rCurrently, there is also no limit to the length of time that employees can work under the second employment contract while on unpaid leave.

So far, 10% of their value has been for administrative expenses. In addition, the duration of many cultural projects, which have been delayed by the pandemic, will be extended.

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to an ordinance dated 1 April 2020 published in the context of the health crisis, the exceptional purchasing power bonus, that is exempted of social contribution and tax-free, can reach \u20ac2,000 for companies that have set up a profit-sharing agreement. Those that do not have one can nevertheless pay the exceptional bonus, but within the limit of \u20ac1,000. \r\rOn the basis of the Article 11 of the emergency law of 23 March 2020 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, an ordinance published on 2 April 2020 relaxes the conditions for payment of the exceptional purchasing power bonus provided for in Article 7 of the law on the financing of social security for 2020 (LFSS 2020). \r\rThe aim is to encourage companies to make use of this scheme in the context of the epidemic, bearing in mind that the premium can now be paid until 31 August 2020 (instead of 30 June).\rCompanies that do not have a profit-sharing agreement ('accord d'int\u00e9ressement') can use the bonus by benefiting from these exemptions, if the amount paid does not exceed \u20ac1,000. Until now, these companies have been excluded from the measure.\rFor companies which implement a profit-sharing agreement on the date of payment of the bonus, the maximum amount exempted is \u20ac2,000 (instead of \u20ac1,000 up to now). The profit-sharing agreement may be for a period of between one and three years if it was concluded between 1 January and 31 August 2020, with the deadline of 30 June 2020 being extended. \rInitially, the exceptional purchase power bonus scheme allowed its amount to be modulated between employees according to remuneration, classification level, length of actual presence during the year or the working time provided for in the employment contract. The ordinance provides for a new possibility of modulation, depending on 'working conditions related to the Covid-19 epidemic'. According to the Ministry of Labour, this new possibility was intended in particular to give companies the possibility of rewarding more people who, for example, are forced to go to their workplace than those who are not obliged to do so",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "So far, only 37,000 companies have paid a bonus in 2020. The Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire call to reward employees 'who had the courage to go to their workplace' despite the health crisis.\rParticularly targeted, large retailers seems to have received the message: Auchan, Carrefour, Intermarch\u00e9, Lidl, Syst\u00e8me U and Leclerc have already announced that their employees would receive a bonus of \u20ac1,000. The same goes for the 15,000 Veolia employees who remained in the field to manage water and waste, or for 5,000 employees of the Total group.\rIt should be noted that some companies have not yet made their decision, waiting in particular to assess the effects of the crisis on their cash flow: they now have until August 31 to do so (compared to June 30 initially).",

Over 60% of holders of family agricultural holdings are over 55 and less than 4 % under 35. The economic crisis and the previous wartime events have contributed to migratory movements from rural to urban areas, particularly of the younger population, resulting in a general decline in the rural population and an increase in the ageing population. This poses a serious threat to the further development and even survival of the rural areas themselves. Young people are a key resource for the development of a modern and competitive agricultural sector, primarily because of their willingness and ability to adapt easily to technological changes, new practices and changing market conditions which is a requirement to increase productivity and competitiveness. Some achieved progress has come under the question due to the recent crisis.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The target groups of financial instruments Micro loans for rural development are primarily small business entities in the agricultural, processing and forestry sectors. Loans can be obtained in the amount of \u20ac 1,000 to \u20ac25,000 and the funds are provided from the Rural Development Program. The repayment period is up to three years with an interest rate of 0.5 percent and a grace period of up to 12 months. The measure offers the possibility of settling bills created up to three months before the loan application is received, with significantly less documentation and a prepared Business Plan form. The Business Plan form is quite simple with pages on two-page questions, which significantly shortens the time of preparation of the application and enables easier and faster processing. \r\rDue to restricted movement of possible beneficiaries and with the desire to simplify the procedure, the Croatian Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments (HAMAG-BICRO) recommends on-line applications. The used of these loans can be an important step in improving the economic performance of farms and facilitating farm restructuring and modernization, notably with a view to increasing market participation and orientation. Furthermore, such financial sources can be of crucial importance to needed agricultural diversification. ",

The Government submitted to the parliamentary procedure amendments to the Act on Sport which enables the Office to allow grants to clubs.\r\rThe responsible authority for the implementation of measure is the Central State Office for Sport. The redistribution within the budget of the State Office for Sport provided HRK 40 million (\u20ac 5.33 million) to help sports clubs to mitigate the consequences caused by the coronavirus epidemic.

Since the beginning of the global pandemic crisis, the company actively monitors the situation and continuously takes the necessary action to preserve employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 health, jobs and insure the business continuity. Following the tightening of general prevention measures by the competent authorities, Valamar closed in March 2020 all hotels and restaurants. With the aim of preserving jobs and business continuity in the conditions where touristic activities were completely suspended, Valamar made the decision to launch  the \"PAUSE, RESTART\" program. It started on 1 April and will last at least 30 to possible 90 days. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The program covers all employees, therefore there will be no layoffs for about 2,800 workers in Valamar. Government support will be used. All employees who cannot work due to the situation will be  referred to PAUSE from April 1. During the PAUSE, employees will be provided with a salary compensation in the amount of minimum 60% of regular salary, but not less than HRK 4,250 net (\u20ac 567). This measure will apply equally to employees and management including permanent and seasonal workers. During the PAUSE, a part of employees and management in charge of the crisis will work primarily on maintenance, conservation and facility security duties, while a part of the staff will communicate with guests and partners. The wages of management will be reduced by up to 30% until all employees return to work. Other employees who will work full-time will continue to receive their regular full pay.\r\rThe Management Board cancelled the General Assembly and with the consent of the Supervisory Board proposed to the General Assembly a withdrawal of dividend payment and to direct these sources into funds for increase liquidity and support measures for the preservation of all jobs. Until the situation improves, Valamar Riviera cannot provide regular services but the company\u2019s goal is not to lose any employee. To prepare on time for RESTART, the company directs its efforts to the development of a new business plan and the preparation of facilities for the start of touristic season. ",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "As part of the Budget 2020 package, the Government announced that it would provide a new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) to both SMEs and large companies (see separate case). Loans were initially due to be worth up to GBP1.2m to support SMEs. On 17 March, this was increased to GPB5 million. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan. The Government has also said the first 12 months of the loan would be offered interest free, with Government meeting the cost of those interest payments. Initially, the interest free period was due to last 6 months.\u00a0 The scheme went live on 23 March 2020.\r\rThe background regulation is the Coronavirus Act 2020, emergency legislation which received Royal Assent on the 25 March after having been fast-tracked through Parliament in just four days.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This temporary\u00a0scheme aims to allow\u00a0small and medium\u00a0businesses across the UK with an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million, which\u00a0are experiencing lost or deferred revenues to access\u00a0loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance of up to \u00a35 million for up to 6 years.The government will also make a Business Interruption Payment to cover the first 12 months of interest payments and any lender-levied fees. This means smaller businesses will benefit from no upfront costs and lower initial repayments.The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to pre-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs.The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank.\u00a0There are 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks, as well as\u00a0challenger banks, asset-based lenders and smaller specialist local lenders.\u00a0 \r\rA business is eligible if:\r\r* it is based in the UK\r* has an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million\r* has a borrowing proposal which the lender would consider viable, if not for the coronavirus pandemic. \r\rTo access the scheme, businesses should approach their own provider \u2013 ideally via the lender\u2019s website. They may also consider approaching other lenders if they are unable to access the finance they need.\u00a0 Decision-making on eligibility for CBILS is fully delegated to the accredited CBILS lenders. On 25 March, the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority together wrote to Britain\u2019s banking sector with a warning not to allow fundamentally viable companies to collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.\r\rFinance terms are up to six years for term loans and asset finance facilities. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years.\u00a0The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt.\r\rAt the discretion of the lender, the scheme may be used for unsecured lending for facilities of GBP 250,000 and under. Initially, the eligibility criteria stated that for facilities above GBP 250,000, the lender must establish a lack or absence of security prior to businesses using CBILS. It also stated that if the lender could offer finance on normal commercial terms without the need to make use of the scheme, they should do so. \r\rHowever, these\u00a0were changed as the scheme progressed. Thus, on the 2 April 2020, the\u00a0Government made changes to the scheme, namely:\r\r* No personal guarantees for facilities under GBP 250k: Personal guarantees of any form cannot be taken under the scheme for any facilities below GBP 250k.\r* Personal guarantees for facilities above GBP 250k: Personal guarantees may still be required, at a lender\u2019s discretion, but recoveries under these are capped at a maximum of 20% of the outstanding balance of the CBILS facility after the proceeds of business assets have been applied. A Principal Private Residence (PPR) cannot be taken as security to support a personal guarantee or as security for a CBIL backed facility.\r* Security: For all facilities, including those over GBP 250,000, CBILS can now support lending to smaller businesses even where a lender considers there to be sufficient security, making more smaller businesses eligible to receive the business interruption payment.\r\rThe Government announced that these changes should be retrospectively applied by lenders for any CBILS facilities offered since 23 March 2020. For any commercial (non-CBILS) facilities offered since the same date, providing the borrower meets the CBILS eligibility criteria, lenders have been asked to bring these facilities onto CBILS wherever possible (e.g. where the lender is accredited to offer the same facility through CBILS) and changes retrospectively applied as necessary.\r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "By the 19 July (the latest available data), the CBILS had received a total of \r112,212 applications (this figure includes\u00a0approved applications, applications that are still to be processed, applications that have been declined or turn out not to be eligible as well as withdrawn applications, where borrowers decide not to proceed). This number also includes a number of\u00a0applications that have subsequently been converted to applications for the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS scheme) - see the [specific case for this new initiative](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/GB-2020-19/944).\r\u00a0\rThe number of facilities/loans approved by the 19 July was 55,674 with a value of \u00a312.20bn (HM Treasury, 2020).",

The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms\u2019 balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms\u2019 credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock.\"\r\rSo the scheme will\u00a0support companies which are fundamentally strong, but have been affected by a short-term funding squeeze, enabling them to continue financing their short-term liabilities. It is also designed to\u00a0support corporate finance markets overall and ease the supply of credit to all firms.\r\r\rThe scheme is open to larger firms whether or not they have previously sought credit in this way. It will operate for at least 12 months.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "As it is anticipated that many employees will be off sick with the virus (the Government states that in a worst case scenario, a fifth of all employees will be absent from work) and that a large proportion of these who work in SMEs will only have statutory entitlement, this measure allows eligible firms to claim back the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) they disburse to such employees.\r\rThe legal reference is the emergency legislation, the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 39 is the relevant regulation (which amends The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992); this section gives the\u00a0Secretary of State the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In Budget 2020, the UK Government\u00a0announced that\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be met in full for up to 14 days per employee. The Chancellor estimates that this will cost up to \u00a32 billion and help up to 2 million businesses. In its factsheet on government support for those affected by Covid-19, HM Treasury said that the eligibility criteria for the scheme would be as follows:\r\r* this refund will cover up to 2 weeks\u2019 SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19;\r* employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible;\u00a0the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020;\r* employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19;\r* employers should maintain records of staff absences, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note;\r* eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of Statutory Sick Pay to self-isolators comes into force;\r\u2022 the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible. Existing systems are not designed to facilitate employer refunds for SSP47.\r\rSSP is the minimum that employers have to pay out to qualifying sick employees. It is currently paid at GBP 94.25 per week (GBP 95.85 from 6 April 2020) and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. In order to\u00a0qualify for SSP, an\u00a0employee\u2019s average weekly earnings must be above GBP 118 (GBP 120 from 6 April 2020). Some employers may pay enhanced sick pay over and above the SSP rate. This would be detailed in an employment contract. The self-employed are not eligible for SSP. \r\rThe Statutory Sick Pay (General) (Coronavirus Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/287) came into force on 13 March 2020. These Regulations (as amended) make it clear in law that employees are entitled to SSP if they are unable to work because they are self-isolating as a result of them or someone in their household showing symptoms of coronavirus.\u00a0 Normally, SSP is paid from the fourth day of absence. However, on the\u00a028 March, the Government made the Statutory Sick Pay (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Waiting Days and General Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/374). These provide that SSP is payable from the first day of absence where a worker is self-isolating because they or someone in their household has shown symptoms of coronavirus. The Regulations have retrospective from 13 March 2020.\rUnder the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.\r\rRegulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\r\rThe guidance says that employers will be covered in the following circumstances: If employers are:\u00a0\r\r* claiming for an employee who\u2019s eligible for sick pay due to coronavirus\r* had a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started on or before 28 February 2020\r* had fewer than 250 employees on 28 February 2020.\r\rThe scheme covers all types of employment contracts, including:\r* full-time employees\r* part-time employees\r* employees on agency contracts\r* employees on flexible or zero-hour contracts.\r",

Futhermore, the Minister of Labour announced the postponement of the entry into force of the second part of the unemployment insurance reform, initially scheduled for 1 April 2020. The new rules, which modified the calculations of the duration of compensation and the reference daily wage used to determine the amount of the back-to-work allowance, are therefore postponed to an entry into force on 1 September 2020. These rules are less favourable to jobseekers.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure apply to:\r- all jobseekers receiving unemployment benefit who reach the end of their entitlement during the month of March, whether they are seasonal, temporary workers or intermittent performers;\r- jobseekers who may have worked again during the period they are entitled to employment benefit, and who may therefore extend the duration of their entitlement to unemployment benefit;\r- beneficiaries of the Specific Solidarity Allowance (ASS) whose renewal takes place in March; the renewal of rights will be studied at the end of the confinement period.\rPayment of unemployment benefit will be extended until the end of the confinement period. This additional compensation will not reduce any future entitlements.\rThe extension is automatic on the part of public employment service (P\u00f4le Emploi) and is effective for payments since the beginning of April. \r\rJobseekers are still required to keep up to date. On the other hand, job search monitoring is suspended during the entire period of confinement. No jobseeker will be struck off the list or sanctioned during this period, ensures a question and answer published on the P\u00f4le emploi website.\r\rA decree published on 14 April provides that the payment of benefits to the unemployed at the end of their rights will go at least 'until the end of the calendar month in which the end of the confinement occurs', details the Ministry of Labour. At this stage, it would therefore be until 31 May 2020. But 'this date will be extended in case of a new extension of the containment measure', the ministry specifies.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the daily Les Echos, between 60,000 and 90,000 jobseekers should arrive at the end of the allowance period in March. It can be estimated a similar number of April. The measure could support from 150,000 to 250,000 jobseekers if the confinement period ends, as expected, on 11 May 2020.",

Generally, businesses are required to submit a VAT return and pay the VAT they owe on a quarterly basis. However, in\u00a0his statement on the 20th of\u00a0March, the Chancellor announced that the next quarter of VAT payments would be deferred.

In his statement on 20 March, the Chancellor announced that the next quarter of VAT payments would be deferred. Details are given on the Government\u2019s Business Support site.\r\rThe deferral will apply from 20 March to 30 June 2020 and will be offered automatically so that businesses will not be required to make an application. All VAT-registered businesses will be eligible. Taxpayers will be given until the end of the 2020-21 tax year to pay any liabilities that have accumulated during the deferral period. VAT refunds and reclaims will be paid by the government as normal. HMRC have advised that customers who normally pay by direct debit should cancel their direct debit with their bank if they are unable to pay. They should do in sufficient time so that HMRC do not attempt to automatically collect on receipt of your VAT return.\r\rOn 26 March, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs\u00a0(HMRC) issued further guidance on this scheme. This underlines that HMRC will not charge interest or penalties on any amount deferred as a result of the Chancellor\u2019s announcement. Businesses will still need to submit their VAT returns on time. VAT payments due following the end of the deferral period will have to be paid as normal, and HMRC have stated that further information about how to repay deferred VAT will be available soon.\r\r",

As a result of this, temporary amendments to the Unemployment Security Act and other related Acts have been made. These amendments remove the waiting period in the sense that job-seekers will receive benefits from day one of the unemployment period. During this period, the state will cover for the expenses (after the waiting period unemployment funds will cover parts of the earnings-related unemployment allowance of their members). \r\r",

Employees on short-time work will receive public money to support their livelihood when not working. Companies on the other hand will not have to pay wages for hours not worked and still be able to keep their workers on board and not lay them off. Changed rules on short time work were implemented by a government ordinance based on the act to enhance the regulations governing short-time work allowance for a limited period as a result of the crisis (Gesetz zur befristeten krisenbedingten Verbesserung der Regelungen f\u00fcr das Kurzarbeitergeld). The improved short-time working scheme is part of a broader rescue package adopted by the Federal Government at the end of March 2020, in order to cushion the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the closure of many businesses. The rescue package also includes other measures, such as easier access to loans for companies, eased up tax and insolvency rules, financial assistance for solo- or micro-entrepreneurs, support for hospitals and other critical infrastructure.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The new rules took effect in retrospect on 1 March 2020. Companies that are faced with a decline in orders due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and shut-down of businesses, can apply for short-time work, if at least 10% of its workforce could be affected by the lack of work. This limit was lowered from 30%. Before short-time work can be granted, any remaining hours on workers' working time accounts have to be depleted. If short-time work is granted, employees will receive 60% of their net income (67% if having children) for all hours not worked. The short-time working allowance is paid by the local employment agency for a maximum of 12 months.To lower the remaining costs, the federal government also decided that social insurance contributions usually paid by employers for their employees, will be fully reimbursed by the Federal Employment Agency. The new rules apply to dependent employees and will also be made available to temporary agency workers.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "First projections regards the usage of the measure are available. The Federal Employment Agency estimates that in March 2020 over 322,000 establishments ran short-time work affecting nearly 2.5 million workers. Estimated figures rise to over 565,000 establishments affecting nearly seven million workers in April 2020. These figures are first estimates.",
            "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners are on board of the Federal Employment Agency and consulted on such issues as prolonging the short-time working duration or other changes to the scheme.",

In addition, the company uses mobile nebulizers spraying disinfectants e.g. in old people's homes.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The waste disposal company DAKA in Hopfgarten wants to use the snow cannon to disinfect larger areas and rooms in the future. Use in production halls, stadiums, train stations, airfields or event halls is conceivable. For smaller areas and spaces, the company also works with mobile nebulizers. So far, a snow cannon has been adapted accordingly. It should already be in use next week. There are five of the mobile nebulizers, some of which are already being used, for example in old people's homes.\r\rOn 31 March, a decree by the Ministry of Health created the basis for this unorthodox measure, said the DAKA. According to this, from 6 April  surfaces and devices that are regularly touched by customers must be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis. 'Of course, manual wiping is the best method', DAKA project manager Matthias Zitterbart admitted in an interview, but this is 'very expensive'.Swiveling snow cannons loaded with hydrogen peroxide with a throw of up to fifty meters are said to bring relief. 'It can be used to disinfect large areas within a very short time', emphasized Zitterbart. For example, dosing tanks and high-pressure pumps had to be integrated into the snow cannon.\r\rThe mobile nebulizers are used for smaller areas, including offices or pharmacies. 'The second smallest devices work autonomously'. said the DAKA project manager. The room was accessible again ninety minutes after the disinfection process. The smallest device is also suitable for reaching corners and niches. Car interiors can also be disinfected.",

In a later step, this was extended to workers with care needs for older people and can now be taken day wise. The employer's consent is needed.\r\rThe legal basis was an amendment to the employment law act \u00a7 18b Abs. 1 Arbeitsvertragsrechts-Anpassungsgesetz (AVRAG).",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The employer's consent to the special care time is needed. The costs for the leave are shared between the state (which pays one third) and the employer (two thirds). Eligibility ends with a monthly wage of \u20ac5,370 (upper threshold).\r\rThe special care period is available for all those employees whose work is not necessary for the maintenance of the business and who do not have other childcare opportunities (schools and kindergartens remain open only for children of those parents whose work is necessary for the maintenance of the business).\r\rThe special care time is not to be offset against regular holiday entitlements or claims for time off or 'flexitime' credits. It is regarded as a 'normal' period of employment, and therefore counts towards employees' entitlements dependent on length of service. The legal base is an adaptation of the Employment Law Amendment Act (AVRAG, \u00a718b/1).\r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the answer to a parliamentary inquiry, 4,874 people were released from work, the majority of whom were women, namely 3,501, which corresponds to a share of 72%. Within the scope of this special leave, 5,490 children up to the age of 14 were looked after. In addition, 30 people with disabilities and 22 people in need of care were looked after.\r\rAccording to the Federal Accounting Agency, relating to figures from May, only 10% of the recipients availed of the maximum amount of three weeks of childcare time. Until May 25, only four applications were rejected. Up until then, \u20ac365,257.61 had been paid out in funding amounts. Up to \u20ac2.5 million were budgeted.\r\rEarlier media reports from 23 June 2020 reported that according to ministry information, almost 9,500 families had made use of the measure, but in light of the most recent update, this seems much overrated.

This deferral of contributions is not automatic and implies an action to modify the payment order or transfer.\r\rFor the self-employed, the monthly due dates of 20 March and 5 April were not deducted in order to relieve their cash flow. Pending further action, the amount of this due date will be smoothed over subsequent due dates (April to December). In addition to this measure, self-employed workers may request: 1/ the granting of payment deadlines, including by anticipation. There will be no late payment increase or penalty; 2/ an adjustment of their contribution schedule to take account of a drop in their income, by re-estimating their income without waiting for the annual declaration; 3/ Intervention by the social action for the partial or total payment of their contributions or for the allocation of exceptional financial aid.\r\rOther measure allow the employer to postpone some tax payments.",

This reduction applies to up to 30 employees and on that portion of the employee\u2019s wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month. This entails tax relief of up to SEK 5 300 per employee and month. To provide equivalent relief to sole traders, a reduction of individual contributions has also been introduced. The proposal\u2019s cost to public finances are estimated to SEK 33 billion.\r\rThe rules came into force on 6 April.

To alleviate some of the pressure on companies, the government has temporarily changed the rules for tax allocation reserves, so that sole proprietors severely affected by the outbreak will receive tax cuts. \r\rIn addition, all companies will also be able to defer tax payments. \r\rThese measures are applicable retroactively from January 1 2020, and are regulated in the Tax Procedure Act (2011:1244) (Skattef\u00f6rfarandelag (2011:1244)).",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The new rules on tax allocation reserves mean that 100% of the taxable profits for 2019, up to SEK 1 million, can be set aside in the tax allocation reserve, which can then be set off against possible future losses. This means that many people can get back the preliminary tax they paid in 2019. This proposal concerns sole traders and natural persons who are partners in Swedish partnerships. \r\rAdditionally, all companies are now able to defer payments of employer contributions, preliminary tax on salary and value added tax, reported monthly or quarterly. The companies' deferral includes three months' tax payments and may be submitted for a maximum of 12 months.\r\rThe new rules are proposed to take effect on 7 April 2020 but can be applied retroactively from 1 January 2020, meaning that companies that have paid tax into their tax account in February and March can get the tax refunded from the Swedish Tax Agency.\r\rPostponement will not be granted to companies that mismanage their finances or are otherwise dishonest. Deferral may not be granted to enterprises that have greater tax liabilities.",

The aim of the measure is to ease the financial pressure on Swedish employers, who would normally bear the economic burden for the first two weeks of an individual employee's sick leave compensation. The measure is regulated in the Act (2020:190) on changes in the Act (1991:1047) on sick pay (Lag (2020:109) om \u00e4ndring i lagen (1991:1047) om sjukl\u00f6n).",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Swedish employers are, under normal circumstances, protected against high costs for sick leave. Normally, employers are reimbursed for sick pay costs exceeding a certain share of the wage costs (maximally SEK 250 000 per year). But due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the parliament and government have decided to relieve all employers of the entire sick pay responsibility during April and May 2020. \r\rUnder the new system, employers pay out sick leave compensation as usual to their employees. They do not need to apply directly for the reimbursement but declares sick pay costs in their usual PAYE tax return for these months. The Swedish Tax Agency then forwards the information to the Social Insurance Agency, which then compensates the employer.\r\rSelf-employed persons will also be compensated in that they can receive standardized sick pay for days 1\u201314.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "All employers in Sweden are covered by this measure. It is too early to say how many will be receiving compensation, but the number is expected to be very high. ",

If another member of the household can provide for the care, e.g. because said person is benefiting from short-time work during the period of leave for family reasons applied for, then the parent of the child cannot benefit from leave for family reasons. Moreover, both parents (or spouse) cannot take leave for family reasons at the same time.\r\rThese limitations do not apply in the case of telework that remains work performed from home and during which the parent cannot provide care for the child.\r\rThe government decided that this COVID-19 related measure for families will be extended beyond the Etat the crise until the 25 of November 2020. The leave for family support ends however if the approved childcare structure notifies the Minister that it has resumed all or part of its activities and that there is a place available in the approved service for the concerned child. \r\r  ",

Those who have neither access to 'Finanzonline' nor a citizen card can apply for an electronic AMS account by email or phone. Then, however, the processing can take a few days. If waiting is not an option, unemployed can also register as unemployed using a form on the AMS website. It is also possible to report unemployment by email. The last option is to call the AMS to have the necessary forms sent to you by post.\r\rFor those who receive unemployment benefits and the entitlement period would come to an end (thus receiving the lower emergency assistance), the 'Corona crisis period' is not calculated towards this entitlement, i.e. unemployment benefits are prolonged for the duration of the crisis.",

The minister specified that the previous family hardship compensation fund had been increased by \u20ac30 million which are now available for single payments to those affected. From 15 April 2020, parents who had been employed until 28 February and are now on  short-time work or have become unemployed due to the crisis are eligible. Self-employed persons with losses could also apply for payment. This applies to families with children who receive family allowance. The payment is valid for three months, but is paid once at the beginning and does not have to be paid back.\r\rThe exact amount of support depends on previous income. Aschbacher cited as an example a family with two children and \u20ac3,000 net family income, which would receive \u20ac780 for three months after the father's unemployment. The aim is to compensate for the loss of income due to unemployment or short-time work, the Ministry said. \r",

The landlord may not claim the arrears of payment in court until the end of 31 December 2020 or cover them from a deposit handed over by the tenant.\rIn addition, the landlord may not legally demand payment of rent due between 1 April and 30 June 2020 until the end of 31 December 2020, nor may he/she cover it from a security deposit provided by the tenant.

Many people are even more concerned with how they should pay their next electricity bill.\r\rEnergy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Green Party) and Wolfgang Urbantschitsch (Board Member of E-Control) explained why these concerns are unfounded. Even if there are payment difficulties, there will be no shutdowns on the part of the energy suppliers.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Until further notice, in any case until May 1st, \"no one in Austria will turn off electricity, gas or heat, \" the minister and the E-Control board assured. This applies to the population, but also to micro and small companies. Energy minister Ms Gewessler said it was a quick and unbureaucratic consensus in the industry. \"This is a good and important contribution,\" said the Green politician. However, this is not a legally fixed regulation.The energy suppliers would share the risk with the network operators, said the minister responsible for energy and the environment.According to Urbantschitsch, it is also possible to arrange a deferral of payments or an installment plan with the utilities, or at most a reduction of advance payments for companies, since there is a reduction in energy consumption for company closings.\r\r**Chamber of Labour AK favours legal regulation**\rThe major energy suppliers for electricity and gas have already announced that they will not switch off during the Corona crisis. The AK also expressly welcomes this voluntary principal. \"But all energy suppliers, including small and above all local and district heating suppliers, have to be brought on board,\" says Christa Schlager , head of the economic policy department at the AK. That seems to have succeeded with Thursday's agreement.\r\rAccording to E-Control, there were around 43,000 shutdowns in electricity and around 4,000 in gas in 2018. There are no official shutdown figures for the heating sector, but one thing is certain: In Austria around 140,000 people could not afford to keep their home sufficiently warm in 2018. This is also shown by a current study of heating types by the AK. Therefore, the AK is now calling for a legal shutdown ban for electricity, gas and heat during the duration of the Corona crisis.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "As part of the announced aid measures to the economy, the government has allowed renters to request a deferral of income tax lump sums for the first quarter 2020. However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.\r\rThis measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  \r\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists. According to the current tax rules adopted, the owners pay between HRK 150 and 1,500 (\u20ac 20 -200) per bed in annual taxes. The amount is determined by the Assembly of the municipality. If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (\u20ac100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. \r\rThe amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than HRK 150,00, nor more than HRK 1.500,00. If the representative body does not decide on the amount of the lump-sum tax (per bed/accommodation unit in the campsite/accommodation unit in the Robinson tourism facility), the lump-sum tax is set at HRK 750.00.representative body of the local self-government unit.\r\r\r",

This quick initiation was possible because the country had already prepared to start electronic prescriptions in a pilot project in two political districts in the regional province in Carinthia in April 2020. The measure is targeted especially to those who need long-term medication. It stands to be seen whether it will be prolonged after the Corona crisis is over.\r\rIn addition to the electronic prescription, further measures for the period of the pandemic were introduced, including for instance the suspension of the authorization requirement (chief physician requirement) for many medications. Furthermore, ambulance transports are free of charge until further notice; the same applies to medical aids and aids up to a total of \u20ac1,500 as well as X-ray and cross-sectional examinations. Sickness reports to doctors are currently also possible by telephone. Doctors, psychotherapists and midwives can also invoice necessary telemedical treatments (via Skype, video conference or telephone) such as a service performed in the ordination.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The procedure of getting an electronic recipe is that the patient calls the doctor's office. The doctor issues the prescription and saves it in the patient's (pre-existing) e-medication. The information reaches the pharmacy automatically via e-medication. There, the patients can either pick up the medicine themselves or send someone.\r\rIn cases where e-medication is not working or is not yet working, doctors were also given the opportunity to send prescriptions to the pharmacies by fax or email. The electronic prescription is primarily intended to help older people and people with previous illnesses to avoid medical practices as best they can given the spread of coronavirus in Austria. Accordingly, the measure is mainly intended for people with long-term medication. However, in principle, it is also possible that the doctor prescribes medication for acute cases. ",

To counteract this, a package of measures was first presented by the government on 19 March.

This would mean that the police can give those affected by domestic violence applications for an injunction against violent partners at first contact and take the completed forms with them on inspection visits a few days later. Applications can also be submitted electronically. The removal of violent offenders would also be guaranteed in quarantine areas. On 5 April, new measures where presented and figures showing a slight decrease in the number of domestic violence cases.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "When presenting measures in mid-March, it was emphasised that the 24-hour helpline had been increased in terms of funding and staff and that online advice for women at risk of violence was expanded. Furthermore, information brochures on the protection against violence were being published, to be distributed in supermarkets. A professional online help and advice service (\"help chat\") has been available from 19 March 2020 every day from 3 pm to 10 pm for women and girls affected by violence, in several languages (German, English, Turkish, Farsi / Dari (Persian), Russian, Bulgarian and Arabic).\r\rOn 5 April, the interior minister presented a new campaign \u2018Safe at home\u2019 (Halt der Gewalt), which is designed to help women with violent partners. He appealed to victims of domestic violence, mostly women and children, not to remain silent. Police officers would know exactly what to do in a specific case, they were \u2018trained to decide exactly that\u2019 - and also for prevention.\r\rSince the weekend, there has been extensive information and services on the subject of violence in the family on the website of the Ministry of the Interior, and additional advertisements since Sunday.

Due to travel bans, maintaining this care has become a major problem. But also those who are cared for by family members may encounter capacity problems, as well as those in older people's homes or care homes, when staff get sick or are in quarantine.\r\rThus, the government has announced to provide a specific COVID-Fund worth \u20ac100 million for the 460,000 persons in need of care, to be distributed among Austria's nine federal states (as nursing care lies within their competencies).

The federal government will make the capacities available to the states that have been freed up by the closure of the spa and nursing homes. \r\rIn addition, civilian servants (Zivildiener) are used to relieve the personnel situation (see separate entry AT-2020-11/463 in this database), even if they are to be used for basic care only. At the same time, civilian servants who were currently working in federal institutions such as museums would be assigned to organisations in need of support, e.g. in the nursing area. Institutions and people who need support would have to report their need for civil servants to the respective regional office of the Red Cross.\r",

This was on top of a series of measures announced at Budget 2020 on the 12 March, where the government announced GBP 30 billion of additional support for public services, individuals and businesses experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.\u00a0 \r\rChanges to SSP were part of the initial Budget\u00a0package, subsequently extended on the 17 March, and accounted for in Sections 39 to 44 of the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 40 amends the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.\u00a0 Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the changes in SSP will be back-dated to 13th of March.\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In order to traditionally qualify for SSP (currently \u00a394.25 and payable by employers for a maximum of 28 weeks), there is a wait of three\u00a0days before an individual employee becomes eligible. However, under the new ruling,\u00a0SSP will be\u00a0paid from day 1, rather than day 4 of an individual's\u00a0absence from work if that person is\u00a0absent from work due to sickness or the\u00a0need to self-isolate caused by COVID-19. This applied retrospectively from\u00a0the 13th of\u00a0March.\u00a0\r\rMoreover, from\u00a0the 20th of March\u00a0onwards, those who have COVID-19 or who are advised to self-isolate will be able to obtain an \u201cisolation note\u201d by visiting the National Health Service (NHS) 111 online and completing an online form, rather than visiting a doctor. For COVID-19 cases, this replaces the usual need to provide a \u201cfit note\u201d after seven days of sickness absence. \r\rFor those not eligible for\u00a0SSP e.g. the\u00a0self-employed or those earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of GBP 118 per week, but who have\u00a0COVID-19 or are advised to self-isolate, the government says that they can\u00a0now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit (UC) or new style Employment and Support Allowance. \r\rFor those who are\u00a0self-employed and receiving Universal Credit with\u00a0COVID-19 or advised to self-isolate, the requirements of the Minimum Income Floor will be temporarily relaxed. This change took effect on 13 March and will last for the duration of the outbreak, to ensure that self-employed UC claimants will receive support.\r",

From the 16 April 2020, regulations were passed so that\u00a0any person classed as extremely vulnerable and at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19), and who have been advised to remain at home for at least 12 weeks will be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP). The process is known as shielding, and the regulations mean that people are deemed as incapable of work for the period in which they are shielding.\r\rThere are around 1.5 million \"extremely vulnerable\" persons in the UK, who were directed to shield for at least 12 weeks. However, 'shielding' is to end on the 1 August, with those who have been shielding being able to return to work. Thus, those who are shielding will  continue to be eligible for SSP until 31 July, but this ends on the 1st of August (UK Government, 2020).\r\rIf an individual cannot work as they are shielding due to coronavirus (COVID-19), then they will be entitled to receive SSP for every day that they are unable to work. They will be entitled to SSP from day one of sickness, in line with how SSP will be paid to those self-isolating, or absent, due to coronavirus. Individuals must, however, shield for a minimum of four days to be eligible for SSP payment from day one. Individuals must also meet the other eligibility requirements for SSP.\r\rThe changes have been made, as previously those individuals who were shielding were not entitled to SSP, and the amendments are intended as a safety net for individuals in cases where their employer opts not to furlough them under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and does not have other suitable policies in place, e.g. allowing the individuals to work from home.\r\r\r2. On the 28th of May, those\u00a0who\u00a0have been\u00a0told by NHS Test and Trace that they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. This requires 14 days' self-isolation, but this period is superseded or extended by the seven day self-isolation rule if the person develops symptoms (UK Government, 2020).\r\r",

Where a\u00a0tenant is experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19, the government will ensure\u00a0they do not face the threat of eviction for at least three months:\r\r* The government has agreed with mortgage lenders that they will offer repayment holidays of three months to households in financial difficulty due to COVID-19.\r\r* This will also apply to landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.\r* The offer of a payment holiday can be made available to customers who are up to date with payments and not already in arrears.\r* Customers who are concerned about their current financial situation should contact their lender at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss whether this is a suitable option for them.\r* Under the Coronavirus Act,\u00a0landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a three month period. This applies to private and social renters.\r* At the end of this period, landlords and tenants will be expected to work together to establish an affordable repayment plan, taking into account tenants\u2019 individual circumstances. \r",

Owners entered the crisis with lower average housing costs and a bigger financial buffer than renters, and have also been more successful at directly reducing housing costs in recent weeks. While just one-in-twelve home owners applying for a mortgage holiday have been refused, that figure stands at one-in-two for those renters who have sought a rent reduction. While the social security system potentially offers a (more generous) backstop for renters, eligibility rules and caps leave some renters without adequate support. The study\u00a0showed that one-third of new benefit claimants are in housing cost arrears.\u00a0 ",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Wages and working conditions of health care workers and a strong labour shortage have been a matter of concern for long; in 2018 government even set up an expert commission to address these problems. Industrial relations are poorly developed, a sectoral collective agreement is not in place; a statutory minimum wage is set by a sectoral minimum wage commission composed of various stakeholders. Major church-related organisations, NGO and private employers do not engage in collective bargaining; employers criticize the underfinancing of the statutory heath insurance.   \r\rAgainst this background the new sectoral agreement on a COVID-19 bonus for health care workers is a very new development. Some NGO founded the employer organisation BVAP for changing employment relations in the sector by engaging in collective bargaining. Wage negotiations with the United Services Union ver.di are ongoing since late 2019. Business organisations are highly critical of the new agreement saying that they do not see where the money shall come from. \r\rThe collective bargaining partners BVAP and ver.di wish for their agreements - this one as well as future ones - to be extended by the labour minister.",

They shall be paid an extra \u20ac1,500 bonus in July 2020 on top of their monthly wage as compensation for the very strong burden they carry because of COVID-19. Part time workers shall receive the bonus depending on the number of hours worked. Trainees in vocational training shall receive \u20ac900 extra.\r\rThe agreement is independent of the collective bargaining partners' ongoing negotiations of a sectoral wage agreement. The bonus shall be paid on top of  and shall have no impact on the level of the wage.",

For this, the Executive has approved that, in the event that a company suspends its activity due to the health crisis, the temporary contracts that its workers have (including training, relief and interim contracts) are also suspended. After this crisis, the duration of these eventual contracts will be prolonged for the time they have been suspended.\r\r",

On the contrary, RDL 8/2020 refers to the suspensions of contracts decided by the company, after confirmation of the force majeure by the competent Labor Authority, or after processing the consultative and negotiating period. Therefore, the paralysis of the effects of the reciprocal obligations of the parties to the temporary contract requires that the causes concur and that the expressed procedural rules have been followed. It is for these assumptions and conditions that it is established that the suspension also has the additional, and exceptional, effect of interrupting the calculation of the term of life or duration of the temporary contract.\r\rThe norm refers to temporary contracts in general, although it is specified that training, relief and interim contracts are included.\r\rThe interruption of the calculation means that the period of suspension of the contract does not count for the purposes of determining neither the agreed term of validity nor the maximum duration.

In Spain, in 85% of housing leases, the owner is a natural person, a small owner. This particularity of the rental market in Spain makes it especially necessary that the measures adopted facilitate agreements between the parties to allow the payment of rents. For this reason, proposals are established in this area aimed at the necessary protection for the most vulnerable groups that may significantly affect their ability to cope with rent, while ensuring a balance between the parties that prevents the vulnerability of tenants from being shifted to lessors, especially those for whom rental income may be essential.",

If the Lawyer of the Administration of Justice understands that the situation of alleged economic vulnerability is present, he will decree the suspension retroactively to the date on which it occurred for the time strictly necessary, following the report of social services. The decree that establishes the suspension will expressly state that, once the fixed period has elapsed, the calculation of the days referred to in article 440.3 will be resumed or it will indicate a date for the hearing.",

For this reason, a temporary extraordinary subsidy is created from which they will be able to benefit in the absence of activity, the reduction in hours worked or the termination of the contract as a consequence of COVID-19. The amount of the subsidy will depend on the remuneration previously received, as well as the reduction in activity suffered, requiring proof of such reduction from the employer. This subsidy is compatible with the maintenance of other activities and the maximum amount to be received will be the SMI without extraordinary payments.\r\rThe health crisis caused by COVID-19 has triggered new situations of need linked to the lack of employment and has aggravated the situation in which previously unemployed people found themselves. Although the state system of unemployment benefits and also the welfare systems of the autonomous communities have served to respond to some of these situations, it is necessary to complete the scope of coverage in order to include new situations of need due to lack of employment generated by the current health crisis.\r\r",

They requested that opening hours should be limited to 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for the duration of the school closings for retail shops, as the measures would put many of the 400,000 domestic retail employees in a bind and demanded that the opening times in the shops .\r\rInitially, the employers organisation (WK\u00d6) had rejected the union's demand for a temporary and significant reduction in working hours. 'The trade is fundamentally against any legal shortening of the opening times' said WK\u00d6 trade chairman Peter Buchm\u00fcller. The food trade in particular is an important infrastructure for maintaining the security of supply for the entire population and is 'well equipped'. \r\rDue to the recent measures by the federal government, the shopping behavior of Austrians has changed. Social partners notice that customers shop less often, but buy more. The customer frequency decreases at a later hour. \r\rTherefore, the commercial social partners have agreed to adjust the opening hours accordingly. In a joint protection package for employees and apprentices in the Austrian trade, we have agreed that the shops will be open from Monday, March 23, 2020, from 7:40 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. Normal opening hours (i.e. like before) could be resumed in May again, after the legal regulation had expired.\r\rOn 23 March 2020, social partners agreed on a package of measures to protect retail employees.",

To protect employees, social partners recommend that retailers implement the following measures as quickly as possible: \r\r* Plexiglass panes (\"breath protection\") and spacers at all checkouts and counters.\r* Gloves and hand disinfectants for all employees and apprentices (as soon as available again)\r* Regular disinfection of checkout workplaces, break and lounge rooms and the toilet facilities due to shorter cleaning intervals\r* Floor markings at all checkouts and counters to ensure the distance between customers and an orderly process in the store.\r* No scanning of customer cards by employees\r* Orderly access to all shops\r* When there is a particularly high number of customers at peak times, retailers should ensure that not too many customers are admitted at the same time.\r* And to provide increased information of customers.\r",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Given existing staff shortages in the National Health Service after a decade of austerity and cuts, combined with the then impending scale of the coronavirus epidemic and predictions that many frontline health workers would themselves be taken ill and be away from work, the Government exhorted health care workers, retired in the past three years, to return to work in the health service.\r\rThe Coronavirus Act 2020 contains provisions for the emergency registration of health professionals, social workers and also covers emergency volunteers (leave and compensation). \r\rThe Government states that the Act will allow an increase in the numbers of available health and social care workforce and reduce the number of admin tasks they have to perform so they have more time to spend with patients.\r\rTo support this, the Act will:\r\r\u2022enable regulators to emergency register suitable people as regulated healthcare professionals, such as nurses, midwives or paramedics. This might include (but will not be limited to) recently retired professionals and students who are near the end of their training. Registered staff can then be used appropriately, with decisions made on a local basis, to increase the available health and social care workforce and enable essential health and care services to function during the height of the epidemic\r\r\r\u2022enable regulators to temporarily add social workers to their registers who may have recently left the profession. This will ensure vital continuity of care for vulnerable children and adults\r\r\r\u2022enable employees and workers to take Emergency Volunteer Leave in blocks of 2, 3 or 4 weeks\u2019 statutory unpaid leave and establish a UK-wide compensation fund to compensate for loss of earnings and expenses incurred at a flat rate for those who volunteer through an appropriate authority. This will ensure that volunteers do not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of performing a public good. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of health and social care services and are particularly important in caring for the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly, those with multiple long-term conditions or those suffering from mental ill-health\r\r\r\u2022provide indemnity for clinical negligence liabilities arising from NHS activities carried out for the purposes of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, where there is no existing indemnity arrangement in place. This will ensure that those providing healthcare service activity across the UK are legally protected for the work they are required to undertake as part of the COVID-19 response. This is in line with and will complement existing arrangements\r\r\r\u2022suspend the rule that currently prevents some NHS staff who return to work after retirement from working more than 16 hours per week, along with rules on abatements and drawn-down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work. This will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and also allow retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.\r\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "More than 60,000 retired doctors and nurses who had retired in the last three years were\u00a0written to and told \"Your NHS Needs You\",\u00a0urged to come back to the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.\u00a0 Student nurses and medical students are also being offered temporary work as the health service struggles to cope with rising demand and growing staff shortages.\u00a0 Officials said those who join the \"NHS Army\" by re-registering with regulators will be assessed to see what kind of help they could offer in the battle against the pandemic.\r\rOn the 27th of March, retired police officers were also asked to return to work, in either a voluntary or paid capacity. Those officers nearing thirty years' pensionable service have also been asked to delay retirement. The request came as\u00a0one in five police officers were off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus.\u00a0 The Met, which is Britain\u2019s biggest force, is already understood to be experiencing absentee rates of 20%. This already high figure came\u00a0before London hits its peak, with officers and staff missing because they have contracted the virus or are having to self-isolate.\r\rFinally, the Government and NHS England called\u00a0for a 'volunteer army' to help the vulnerable during the coronavirus crisis. Over 750,000 people in just four days signed up the NHS's call for volunteers, three times the original target. On the 7th of April, the Royal Voluntary Service, the charity delivering the volunteer effort,\u00a0completed checks for the three quarters of a million applications and from the 8th, the NHS Volunteer Responders will support 2.5 million at risk people.\u00a0Their duties will include:\u00a0delivering medicines from pharmacies;\u00a0 driving patients to appointments; bringing them home from hospital; \u2022making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home; and transporting medical supplies and equipment for the NHS.\r\rThousands of these approved volunteers will be offered tasks from the 8th\u00a0via the GoodSAM app and will start helping people safely, with more expected to get requests over the coming weeks as referrals ramp up.\r\rHealth professionals, pharmacists and local authorities can upload requests for help on the NHS Volunteer Responders referrer\u2019s portal and volunteers pick the job they want to do that day and close the task once complete.\u00a0 Volunteers show themselves as available when their app is switched to \u2018on duty\u2019.\r\r",

But of course artists also have access to the entire range of support. We want to prevent people from losing their jobs, their income and at all costs everyday life can no longer afford. Nobody should be left behind ' explains State Secretary for Art and Culture Ulrike Lunacek on the unprecedented situation, which is very challenging for the entire art and culture business.\r\rThe federal government's mix of measures to combat the effects of COVID-19 includes a range of support for the cultural sector. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "An overview of measures for artists is available on the [Federal government's page:](https://www.bmkoes.gv.at/Themen/Corona/Corona-Kunst-und-Kultur.html)\r\rIn addition to the general support measures set by government (for example, the [Corona short time work scheme](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-10_229.html) or the [hardship fund for self-employed](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-13_212.html)), the page also lists specific funds which are only available for artists.\r\rThis includes, for instance:\r\r* COVID-19 fund for artists and intermediaries ('Kulturvermittler');\r* All artists who are not eligible to apply the hardship fund of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce can bring an application to the KSVF (Artist Social Insurance Fund) from 30 March 2020. \r\rThe support is intended to compensate for the loss of income caused by closings and cancellations. \r\rThe KSVF's COVID-19 fund is endowed with up to \u20ac5 million and is intended to ensure rapid aid. In addition to artists, cultural mediators can now apply for this grant. The amount paid out by the KSVF corresponds to that of the hardship fund. The fund consists of two phases:\r\r* in the first phase \u20ac1,000 are paid as emergency aid (until 2 July 2020), \r* in the second phase (starting on 10 July), a one-time payment of \u20ac3,000 is paid (amount received from phase 1 is deducted)\r\rA separate service page has been set up for loss of income due to the Corona measures: KSVF service fund.\r\rIndividual funds run by copyright collecting societies (e.g. music, visual arts, film-making, etc.). Seven dedicated funds are also listed on the webpage.\r\rIn addition to the state instruments for compensating artists' loss of income, there is now also a private initiative. To help artists in the current crisis, foundations have joined together to form the \"Foundations Help Artists\" initiative and are supported by well-known people.\r\rWork grants from the City of Vienna due to COVID-19: Since the end of March, freelance artists and freelance scientists with their main residence in Vienna have been able to apply for one-time work grants of up to \u20ac3,000. In this crisis situation, there should be the opportunity to continue to pursue artistic and scientific activities (project development, reading, exhibition and lecture preparation and the like).",

The Microcredit Fund tool is aimed at small companies - the so-called micro-enterprises, as well as companies that have just started their business (to have up to three years of business history at the moment, with possible expansion - up to five years).\r\rThe idea is to enable banks to support this vulnerable group of start-ups that may have started a small family business with loans up to BGN 50,000 (\u20ac25,000). This will support their investment plans for the crisis and working capital so that they can continue their operations.\r\rThis tool is aimed at a target group of recipients who generally do not have easy access or have no access to bank financing at all - companies with no credit history.",

Only the part of salaries up to HUF 214,300 net (twice the minimum wage - \u20ac612 as of 15 Apr) per month receive the income supplement, earnings after that threshold are not subsidised. \r\rThe government calculates that on average a monthly HUF 64,500 per employee will be paid out, so the total cost for 3 months could be HUF 193.6bn (according to government calculations) or HUF 128bn according to our (KOPINT-T\u00e1rki Institute) calculations. \rAdditional criteria for eligibility-the employer must agree to keep headcount level until the end of the year in order to be considered for the subsidy\r\r* the shortened work contract may not drop below four hours per day of working time \r* employers must organise a training for the employee in 30% of the hours that have been cut from working time and pay wages for this time as well.\r\rApplications open on 16 April, 2020",

The total number of employed was 4,023,600 in 2019. Data show that around half of Hungary\u2019s workforce is employed in jobs with high or medium vulnerability to being lost due to covid-19.\r\rApplications must be filed to the public employment services for review. Critics note that the employer has attractive alternatives: if dismissed, employees get unemployment benefits for three months, they can be sent home on unpaid leave, or citing the COVID-19 situation as a vis maior they get no wages for down-time. Critics also argue that the measure came much too late, 5 weeks after Hungary announced a 'state of danger' for the pandemic on 11 March 2020.\r\rSo far (up to mid-July) the companies applied for the support for 200,000 employees, the applied funding amounted to HUF 33 billion (about \u20ac90 million). The funding has been approved for nearly 14,000 companies, and for 180,000 employees. \r\rThe proportions of the types of supported companies were as follows:\r\r* 13.3% micro-enterprises, \r* 25% small companies, \r* 27.9% medium-sized companies, \r* 33.8% large companies, \r\rWith regard to sectors, the composition is the following: \r\r* manufacturing: 49.1 % (nearly 100,000 applications); \r* trade and machinery: 16.7%, nearly 33,000 applications; \r* accommodation, hospitality: 9.1%, nearly 18,000 applications; \r* administrative activities and supporting services administration: 4,9% nearly 10,000 applications.\r\r",

The goal is to protect people who lose their income because of the pandemic and cannot make debt repayments. Another goal is to keep lending activities afloat despite the crisis.",

The length of the loan will be extended by the period of the freeze. The Banking Association said the deferred loan payments would amount to about HUF 450 billion in the 9-month period, but our estimations based on partner interviews suggest it would be at most half of that amount. Clients must sign a statement (online) to opt out of the payment freeze scheme, so the default is that they do get the suspension.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Hundreds of thousands of people or about 30-50% of credit clients have indicated to their banks until April that they would not avail of the payment freeze option and continue to make payments as before. The prediction of the National Bank of Hungary on the uptake was about 30% of all individual clients at the time. In its inflation report of June 2020, the National Bank of Hungary said that the loan suspension for individuals managed to serve its purpose of replacing lost income so that consumption could stay level or flatten out. Out of a total of about HUF 1,100 billion (\u20ac3.274 million) in household loan repayments eligible for the deferral, HUF 600 billion worth of repayments were requested for deferral under the scheme. The bank estimates that 50-70% of the amount freed in this way was spent towards consumption by households (private individuals).",

The length of the loan will be extended with the period of the freeze. \r\rThe Banking Association said the deferred loan payments would amount to about HUF 450 billion in the 9-month period, but our estimations based on partner interviews suggest it would be at most half of that amount.After the freeze period the loan is extended to the period necessary to keep loan payments to their pre-COVID levels and banks cannot charge compound interest either. These rules apply to any fees related to the loan, too.Based on central bank data, the measure could affect up to HUF 8,300 billion worth of bank loans at 33,000 companies.",

Out of a total of HUF 2,500 billion (\u20ac7.44bn) worth of loans eligible for the repayment deferral, HUF 1,500 billion worth of company loan repayments were actually deferred under the scheme by June 2020. This is estimated to be equivalent to about 6.5% of companies\u2019 annual payroll costs. The measure could have an indirect effect on employment, as companies with long-term loans employ about 1.25 million people. Sectors that are indebted to a higher rate include: agriculture commerce, accommodation and catering, and processing.",

It is considered as a requirement for the employer the need to ensure, at all times, the availability of appropriate means of prevention against COVID-19.\r\rThe remuneration received for the work activity performed, under the extraordinary measures to make employment more flexible, will be compatible with different unemployment benefits.",

The norm establishes that these groups will not have to present these tax payments in April, as usual, but extends the term by one month until May 20 to mitigate the economic impact caused by the COVID-19 crisis.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The decree states that taxpayers (SMEs and self-employed) with a turnover of up to \u20ac600,000 will have until May 20 to file the tax returns for the month of April. In other words, they may postpone the filing of the quarterly VAT declaration, the fractional payment of corporation tax, as well as the personal income tax. In the case of domiciled declarations, the term is also extended by one month and goes from April 15 to May 15. Regardless of the time of submission, all charges will be made on May 20. That also includes statements filed before the 15th of this month.\r\rIn this way, the Government shows its commitment to SMEs and the self-employed, who make up the bulk of the productive fabric of Spain. In fact, the measure approved today will benefit 3.4 million taxpayers, who represent 95% of companies and freelancers who must file their tax return in April. In practice, this moratorium represents liquidity of 3,558 million for SMEs and the self-employed.\r\rIn addition, this measure aims to give tax managers and advisors a greater margin to collect the information necessary to comply with the tax obligations of their clients at a time of great difficulty due to the effects of the health emergency.\r\rThis decision is part of the strategy of the Ministry of Finance to combat the effects of COVID-19 on the activity of self-employed and SMEs. In fact, the Government has already approved the possibility that both groups could postpone the payment of taxes to a maximum of \u20ac30,000 for six months, with three months without interest. This measure, with a maximum impact of 14,000 million, could benefit 99.8% of the self-employed and 94% of SMEs, which are those who are below this level of turnover.",

However, this has not avoided a drastic increase in unemployment due to bankruptcies or close downs of parts of a company.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the European Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The goal of the measure is to sustain companies which saw their business affected and impaired by the provisions adopted to face the pandemic and by their consequential socio-economic effects.\r\r (JMD, OJ  1135/\u0392/02.04.2020)",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure provides companies with a cash advance financed by the Greek State amounting to \u20ac1 billion in total. The funds will be provided via the 'taxis' information system as a tax-free amount, which will not be able to be offset or confiscated. \r\rThis measure is addressed to small and medium enterprises of all economic sectors, that have their seat or permanent establishment in Greece, and employ at least 1 and a maximum of 500 employees, in order to deal with the specific issues that such enterprises face in terms of accessibility to credit. Private companies (general and limited liability companies, limited liability companies and private capital companies) that do not employee personnel, regardless their sector, are also eligible for the return on their advance payments.\r\rThe advance will be refunded to the Greek State within the next five years, either in total or partially, depending on the viability of each enterprise. The first year is a grace period and there is no obligation to any repayment, which will take place in equal monthly installments within the remaining four years by applying an extremely low interest rate",

The concept of the same number of jobs does not include voluntarily leavers, retiring on retirement, and fixed-term workers whose employment contract expires after the expiry of the suspension.  \r\rThe job retention clause and the invalidity of any employment contracts also apply to companies which agree to workers whose contracts of employment are suspended from the provision of teleworking work to meet their temporary needs.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "On the 11 March in the Budget 2020 speech, the Chancellor announced the launch of this GBP 500 million Hardship Fund (which applies to England). The Hardship Fund will\u00a0provide council tax relief to help those affected most by coronavirus. The funding will go to local authorities in England to enable them to reduce the 2020 to 2021 council tax bills of working age people receiving Local Council Tax Support. Councils will also be able to use the funding to provide further discretionary support to vulnerable people through other support arrangements such as Local Welfare Schemes.\r\rGuidance for the GBP 500 million Hardship Fund was\u00a0released on the 24th of March,\u00a0aimed at providing clarity to\u00a0local authorities\u00a0on how to allocate the funding following its announcement at Budget.\r\rThis amends s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.\r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In the Guidance issued, the\u00a0Government states that it\u00a0recognises that COVID-19 is likely to cause fluctuations in household incomes and\u00a0that, as a result, some individuals may struggle to meet council tax payments. It says that councils will already have established their local council tax support schemes for 2020-21 and that\u00a0the Government therefore expects that billing authorities will primarily use their grant allocation to reduce the council tax liability of individuals in their area, using their discretionary powers under s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. \r\rFurther, it states that councils may also want to use some funding to deliver increased financial assistance through other local support mechanisms, having considered local circumstances.\rThe Government states that councils should expedite provision of support to individuals in their area, using existing policies and schemes to deliver assistance where practical. Where council clearance processes are considered necessary, to avoid delays, they should be kept as light touch as possible within the governance arrangements of each authority.\r\rIt also states that council tax reductions should be applied as soon as possible from the beginning of the 2020-21 financial year and billing authorities should rebill council taxpayers as quickly as practical. Authorities will want to make the local population aware of how the grant support package will be delivered, e.g. through providing information on their websites.\r\rThe Government confirms that it will fund billing authorities in full for the new burdens cost for delivering the support.\u00a0 Local authorities will wish to maintain a record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "On the 16th of April, the UK Government issued more guidance, in which it stated that all working-age Local Council Tax Support (LCTS) claimants in 2020-21 (who are entitled to working-age LCTS in respect of any part of the 2020-21 council tax liability) will receive a further discount of \u00a3150 under the Hardship Fund. The reduction is to be made through the use of the powers under Section 13A (1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.\r\rCost of measure: \u00a3500 million to be disbursed to local councils.",

The aim of this measure is to facilitate for health and medical care students to help out in the health care sector without their student aid being reduced. However, the measure does not exclusively cover health and medical students as also other occupations are deemed key in the current crisis, and also so as to support those newly unemployed who now wish to start studying.\r\rThe student aid income ceiling is regulated in The Act (1999:1395) on student aid (Studiest\u00f6dslag (1999:1395)).\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In practice, the removal of the income ceiling means that students who have received higher incomes during 2020 than the initially set limit (of SEK 86,782 during half a calendar year), will keep all of their student grants and loans.\r\rFor students who are short of credits due to their school being unable to provide teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, the administrating authority (The Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN)), will take this into consideration.

Rental leases for these companies cannot be terminated in this period, either, so tenants cannot be evicted, although it is not clear if this means on any grounds at all or whether landlords can exercise some of their rights to terminate.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Under Section 3 of government decree 47/2020, the sectors selected as one most affected by the COVID-19 crisis will receive protection from rent increase or rental contract termination. The measure applies to sectors where businesses typically rent rather than own their premises and where the economic impacts of covid-19 have caused financial strains. Although the measure does not specificy if rental contracts are banned from termination even if no rent is paid by the tenant at all, experts agree that with the eviction ban in place, tenants are likely to get away with not paying at all during the 'state of emergency' period while their business is likely to be closed down.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measure could affect about 50,000 compaies, mainly SMEs in the COVID-vulnerable sectors. The rule overrides any rent increases stipulated in the rental contract. Legal experts say that if tenants do not pay rent at all, landlords are likely to seek agreement on special terms rather than lose clients on a shrinking property rental market. Analysts argue that the effectiveness of this measure in supporting businesses is very low, since under the current circumstances property owners were not likely to raise rents anyway, if anything, rents are dropping on current market conditions.",

The support is an extension of the support to self-employed and freelancers with B-income, based in law : BKG 2020-04-01 nr 332 \u2013 Compensations scheme for self-employed in economic crisis as a result of COVID-19.\r\rArtists that have an aggregate A- and B-income and a taxable income from artistic performance between DKK 100,000 and 800,000 a year can apply for the support scheme. The Ministry of Culture will cover 75% of the expected loss of income.\rAccording to scheme, artists can for example, seek compensation for: \rLoss of income based on professional artistic work can be in the form of: \r\r* Failure to sell works, books, etc.\r* Cancelled concerts, performances and performances, etc.\r* Cancelled workshops, teaching and lectures, etc.\r* Other lost income based on professional artistic work as a direct consequence of COVID-19. \r\r\r",

On the other hand, the employer organisations, in particular Danish Chamber of Commerce, and the unions in commerce and trade - HK/Danmark - have pointed out that the original support legislation regarding self-employed and freelancers only includes work that falls under B-income tax. Consequently, they want the provision extended to encompass both A- and B-income for all self-employed and freelancers.",

The employer must have operated for at least 6 months and prove that the request is in connection with the economic hardship suffered due to COVID-19, together with steps taken to overcome the situation. They must agree to keep headcount level with that of a month before and to keep the employee on for at least 3 months after the subsidy ceases, with no salary cuts. The employer cannot be under insolvency procedures. The subsidy does not apply to work carried out at a new location compared with pre-covid (including in home office).\rThe income supplement paid by the state is 40% of gross income, but no more than HUF 318,920 (\u20ac911) per month.

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to this measure, an exceptional bonus of \u20ac1,500 will be paid in May to healthcare workers in the departments most affected by the epidemic and to those in the departments that received COVID-19 patients in the departments least affected. Other health personnel will receive a \u20ac500 bonus, he added, specifying that these bonuses will be free of charges and taxes. All of the hospital staff will also receive a 50% increase in overtime, i.e. an average of more than \u20ac600 per employee, also without taxes or charges, according to the Minister of Health, Olivier V\u00e9ran. Each member of staff will therefore receive an average of \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac2,000, he said, with a total cost to the State of \u20ac1.3 billion. In addition to this, there will be a future bonus for staff in the medico-social sector, in particular those in home for the elderly and dependent persons (EHPAD), which have had to reorganise. To launch this bonus, the government has to discuss with local authorities, particularly with the departments that often finance them, to determine the conditions for financing this bonus",

The bilateral inter-company cooperation by McDonalds and ALDI was developed by the human ressource departments of the two companies. When the measure started Aldi was in need of 3,000 addtional workers whereas Mc Donalds' franchise companies employed 60,000 workers at risk of unemployment. As explained by McDonald's HR manager, the comapny aimed at a very fast solution and and therefore focussed on the individual transfer to another company. \rMcDonalds is affiliated to the federal association of system caterers BdS which negotiated a sectoral Corona-protection agreement with trade union NGG (see factsheet) which states that dismissals shall be avoided. \r\rAldI's staff needs are communicated to regional McDonald's companies (franchises) which offer leaves for workers who want to take up these fixed-term jobs  During the leave, wages are paid by ALDI.",

In order to realize this purpose, the Ministry proposes that income from voluntary work in public health services or with private persons who, according to law or agreement, offer health services to the population, should not, however, result in a reduction or loss of pension. To prevent pension reduction for health professionals taking on extra work during the crisis connected to COVID-19, amendments to three pension scheme regulations were passed. The measure cover health and social standby and service, and the regulations comprise The Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund, pension fund for nurses and pension fund for employees in farmacies.

The measure treats all industries equally, but will especially benefit the most vulnerable companies. The measure covers only limited liability companies, etc. which has gone from surplus in 2018 or 2019, to a deficit in 2020. The delimitation ensures that the companies that benefit from the measure are also suitable to make a profit. Thus, it is avoided that companies that are not fit to make a profit, or who do not initially do business, benefit from the measure.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Companies will have a temporary opportunity to return up to NOK 30 million of corporate deficits in 2020 against taxed profits the previous two years. The tax value of losses in 2020 will be paid to the companies at the tax settlement in 2021. One advantage of the measure is that the extent of payments to the companies depends directly on the severity of the situation. In this way, the measure reinforces the tax system's stabilizing role and ability to curb the decline. The Government proposes that an amount limit of NOK 30 million will be set for the amount of deficit in 2020 that can be reversed against previous profits. The relatively high amount of money means that most profitable small and medium-sized companies with a deficit in 2020 can take full advantage of the scheme. The amount limit is necessary to have some control over how large a loss of proceeds the scheme may entail. With a limit of NOK 30 million for deficit, the measure is estimated to reduce accrued tax revenue from corporate tax in 2020 by the order of NOK 3.5 billion.",

Now employers can use this method of working time arrangement for up to 24 months without signing/modifying a collective agreement.

The exemption provision means that the National Insurance Scheme reimburses employers' expenses for sick leave for coronavirus-related absences from day four to day 16. The employer offsets sick pay and may claim reimbursement from the Labor and Welfare Agency for the number of days exceeding three. The temporary reduction in employer funding responsibility for sick pay for employees related to the coronavirus is estimated on an uncertain basis to result in increased sick pay payments of NOK 4,700 million in 2020.",

The guarantee scheme will be organized through the Guarantee Institute for Export Credit (GIEK).

To take part in the scheme it is required that the company is solvent. For companies that did not have an equity ratio of at least 8 percent at the end of the last quarterly report prior to the corona crisis, financial creditors must waive interest and defer repayment for 3 months to gain access to the guarantees. SAS and Wider\u00f8e satisfy the equity requirement. For Norwegian, an immediate facility of NOK 300 million will be made available. When and if the company achieves a reduction in interest and repayments from creditors, an additional NOK 1.2 billion will be made available. The last NOK 1.5 billion will be made available when the company has improved its solvency to a satisfactory level.

The largest Norwegian companies largely borrow money in the credit bond market. In the near future, many of these companies will need to secure financing in this market. However, the bond market's ability to provide credit has diminished substantially in recent weeks. Liquidity is low and risk premiums are high. Previous experience has shown that the Government bond fund can contribute to a more efficient market for credit bonds. This will make it easier for the big companies to get the liquidity they need in the difficult situation created by Covid-19.",

Within a mandate set by the Ministry of Finance, the National Insurance Scheme Fund (Folketrygdfondet) will decide on which bond loans to invest in. The mandate of the Fund instructs management to seek to achieve the highest possible return on costs over time and at the same time contribute to increased liquidity and capital access to the credit bond market in Norway, within the framework that applies as for the management of the Fund. The return is measured in Norwegian kroner. In its exercise as creditor, the management of the fund shall have as its overriding objective to protect the financial interests of the fund.",

These new rules allow for the coverage of: employees with an annual working time account (forfaits jours) in days or hours - i.e. employees whose working hours cannot be fixed in advance (often managers); civil aviation crews, freelance journalists (who are paid for each article ordered); salespeople with the status of sales representatives (VRP); home-based employees paid on a piecework basis; intermittent entertainment workers and models. The text also clarifies the compensation of employees benefiting from variable remuneration elements",

This decree is applicable to short-time compensation claims submitted from 12 Marc 2020 to 31 December 2020. For the two main categories of workers covered, the rules are the following:\r\r1/ Employees with a \"forfait jours\" in hours and days\rFor employees whose working hours are fixed by a 'forfait-jours\" agreement in hours or days over the year, both the allowance and the short-time work allowance are determined by taking into account the number of hours or days or half-days not worked by the employee. The number of hours taken into account is determined by converting a number of days or half-days into hours according to the following flat-rate periods:\r- a half-day not worked corresponds to 3.5 hours not worked;\r- a day not worked corresponds to 7 hours not worked;\r- a week not worked corresponds to 35 hours not worked.\rDays of paid leave and rest taken during the period of suspension or reduction of activity, as well as public holidays not worked which correspond to working days, are converted into hours according to the same procedures.\r\r2/ Civil aviation flight crew\rIn the case of civil aviation flight crews, whose working hours are organised in the form of alternating days of activity and days of inactivity, the number of hours giving rise to the payment of the allowance and the partial activity allowance shall be determined on the basis of a number of eligible days of inactivity. The latter is determined by taking into account the difference between the number of days of inactivity recorded and the number of days of inactivity normally guaranteed to the employee over the period in question. The number of days of inactivity obtained is converted into hours according to the following rule: each day of inactivity in excess of the number of days of inactivity guaranteed corresponds to 8.75 hours off work, within the limit of the legal weekly duration (35 hours) over the period in question.",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "This publication is the epilogue of a two-week arm wrestling exchange between the Ministry of Labour and construction employers' organizations. Their members have indeed been accused of 'defeatism\" by the Minister of Labour for having chosen to stop almost all the building sites and ask for the partial unemployment of their employees. As of 1 April, 61,000 companies, including all the major players in the sector, representing 565,000 employees (i.e. 50% of the profession) had applied for this, according to the DARES.\rTo break the deadlock, the profession has therefore drawn up, under the aegis of the OPPBTP, its professional prevention body managed on an equal footing, this guide which is supposed to 'provide the conditions for employees to continue working in safety'.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Having received the approval of all the ministries concerned, the guide defines the protocols to be respected with the approval of clients and within the framework of social dialogue, the conditions of use of individual protection, respect for barrier gestures, and the procedures to be followed in the event of travel, for example.\rThese measures are capable of \"enabling a gradual resumption of activity\", as all the employers' federations have stressed. \"It also responds to the specific characteristics of certain worksites, such as those taking place in private homes\", says Patrick Li\u00e9bus, President of Capeb. In return, companies retain the right to suspend their activity, without running the risk of being refused access to partial activity.\r\"Particular attention is paid to the most vulnerable employees,\" the federations state, urging them \"not to involve apprentices, trainees and work-study students on building sites.",

The agreement covers the following issues: telework, full time arranged activity, short-time work, \"fourteen\" and work stoppage. All the measures will apply for the period from 16 March to 30 April 2020, 'possibly with retroactive effect for this period, depending on the situations already in place'.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The main subjects addressed by the agreement are:\r\r1. **Use of teleworking**\rOn a temporary basis and depending on the activity and the technological possibilities available, Daher has set up teleworking \"for a maximum number of group employees whenever possible\". It is up to the manager to regularly assess the workload and the ability of each individual to telework. The manager regularly informs the employee of his or her continued teleworking, or of the possibility of returning to the site \"for service requirements that cannot be carried out remotely\", or of being partially teleworking.\r\r2. **Adaptation of work organisation**\rIn some sectors of the company, the work organisation had to be adapted in order to comply with the instructions for taking up work at the post (cleaning, extended or moved lunch break, etc.). In the context of this \"adjusted full-time activity\", the company undertakes, despite a potential reduction in working hours, to maintain employee remuneration, including team bonuses, basket bonuses, meal vouchers or equivalent meal allowance in the absence of closed collective catering, etc. Moreover, \"as a completely exceptional measure and to take into account the commitment of the employees\", the hours not worked due to these adjusted schedules will not give rise to any recuperation.\r\r3. **Organisation of short-time working**\r\"In accordance with government directives known to date\", \"alternative systems\" to be used before the implementation of the partial activity system are identified in each company. As part of the agreement, and \"subject to the approval of the administration\", the equivalent of a seven-hour day taken as \"time bank/flexible/ reduced working hours (RTT)\" for non-management employees. For managers, one day of RTT (two for metalworking managers) is taken on a mandatory basis. In addition, the agreement continues, the setting of five working days of paid leave over the period of the agreement is imposed.\r\r4. **Remuneration during short-time working**\rIn an approach aimed at preserving purchasing power, Daher raises the remuneration of employees on short-time working to 95% of their net salary, \"instead of the 84% of net salary provided for by law\". In return for this matching contribution and in solidarity with employees whose activity will have been maintained, employees in partial employment will, before December 31, 2020, and as soon as the confinement period has ended, perform up to 25 hours of activity for non-managers and three days for managers, for each full month of partial unemployment. \r\r5. **The \"fourteen-week\" period**\rIn the event that, for safety or health reasons, the employee is sent home at the initiative of the employer or at the request of the client, it is up to the company to find a solution to temporarily offer him/her another assignment or to transfer him/her to another status.\rFor the employee who wishes to take up an assignment at his own initiative \"in a fortnight\" and whose situation is not recognised by the health insurance fund, the company \"shows adaptation and kindness\" to enable him to use as far as possible any other more advantageous arrangement in terms of maintaining remuneration (paid leave, RTT, time bank, flexible, etc.).\r\r6. **Work stoppage**\rIn the event of a work stoppage (illness, childcare, population at risk at COVID-19, maternity, etc.), the employee benefits from the compensation scheme provided for, via the daily social security benefits and the employer's supplement set according to the Daher Group.

The objective of the social partners is to 'preserve the protection of the health and safety of the employees present while maintaining the company's operations as much as possible'.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The temporary adjustment applies, from 19 March to 2 April, to employees working in the 'Manufacturing Front-End and Back-End' and support departments at the Crolles (Is\u00e8re), Grenoble (Is\u00e8re), Rennes (Ille-et-Vilaine), Rousset (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne) and Tours (Indre-et-Loire) plants.\r\rIn order to guarantee 'these essential activities related to the safety of the installations and the quality of the products and services', the teams are reduced. The agreement provides that they may be reduced by up to 50% of the theoretical workforce, with a minimum of two employees per sector. Over the period, the management must draw up a provisional schedule for the composition of the teams, ensuring that there are rotations between employees. In the event of an unforeseen additional absence, one or more employees may be called in to complete the team. In any event, the provisional schedule is adapted on a daily basis to take into account any changes in the situation.\r\rThe employees affected by this reduction in activity shall not suffer any loss of remuneration and shall be paid at the normal time, 'as if they had worked full time according to their usual working hours'. In other words, the agreement specifies that the rest days imposed on certain employees will be considered as actual working time for the calculation of remuneration elements.\r\rIn addition, to limit physical contact, the agreement provides that employees travelling to the sites may travel with their personal vehicle. These trips are financed by the company in the form of mileage allowance payments on the June 2020 payroll at the latest.  All STMicroelectronics employees other than Manufacturing and Production Support who travel to their place of work at the request of their management are also eligible for this measure.\r\rFinally, a systematic temperature reading can be taken at the entrance to the sites. In the event that the temperature exceeds a limit set by the central health, safety and working conditions commission (CSSCT) and the occupational physician coordinating France, employees are invited to go home and consult their treating physician or log on to the health insurance website to obtain a work stoppage.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The agreement applies to production workers of STMicroelectronics which employs about 10,100 people in France. In the group, about 67% of the employees are working in production. About 5,000 to 6,000 employees may be covered by this agreement (estimation).",

On 3 April 2020, they concluded a branch agreement designed to facilitate the taking of paid holidays in order to 'face the difficulties inherent in this period and to prepare as well as possible for a resumption of activity'. The metallurgy agreement on work organisation to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic was signed by the UIMM and the CFDT, CFE-CGC and FO trade union federations.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The agreement stresses, in its preamble, that the COVID-19 epidemic and the measures taken by the public authorities to limit its spread have serious consequences for metalworking companies. But it also underlines the right of everyone to preserve their health and to work safely. Faced with contradictory demands, the signatories call for an appropriate social dialogue in companies. They add that they would like company negotiations to be favoured so that the branch agreement plays exclusively its supplementary role, in accordance with the Labour Code. The agreement of 3 April 2020 does not therefore call into question the company agreements already signed, nor the company negotiations currently underway.\r\r*Short-time working*\rThe agreement invites companies to 'seek with the social partners, beyond the preservation of employment, a change in the conditions of compensation' for short-time working, 'to mitigate its negative impacts' (on the purchasing power of employees).\rThe agreement recalls that the period of short-time working can be used for training actions. It adds that when occupational health and safety conditions are \"irreproachable, guaranteed and applied\", the training action can be implemented \"in situ\", within the company, if necessary, in a work situation. In this context, the joint body in charge of vocational training (OPCO 2i) is invited to provide collective training actions for employees of VSEs and SMEs. \"The signatories thus wish to gradually prepare, under the best conditions, the return to normal activity\u00bb.\r\r*Exceptional management of paid leave*\rThe agreement opens up the possibility for the employer to set or change the date for taking six working days of paid leave per employee. This possibility will be open as soon as the agreement is tabled and will end on October 31, 2020. It may result in the taking of leave in advance of the period during which it is normally intended to be taken.\rThe employer must respect an order of priority. The employer chooses:\r\r* first, the taking of paid leave earned during the previous accrual period;\r* then, the taking of conventional days earned (seniority leave, in particular);\r* lastly, the taking of paid leave acquired during the last vesting period, which may lead to early taking.\rThe employer must respect a period of notice, set at two working days during the confinement period and five days thereafter. The leave period chosen by the employer ends on October 31, 2020.",

This was a package of several measures which have been taken to contrast the outbreak and its effects, announced on 17 March, 2020.\r\rThis measure aims to help small farms and farmers to keep their businesses afloat. It targets enterprises in the horti- and agricultural sectors as a whole because this sector was one of the first to feel a marked hit from the crisis. This includes the provision of food and other grown products, not just for domestic consumption but also for trade. The seasonality of work in this sector and the timing of the COVID-19 crisis seem to have led to this group of enterprises receiving specific support.\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The sectors covered here by this measure include the agriculture and horticulture sector, the fisheries sector, and the aquaculture sector. These sectors are all confronted by an international and domestic decrease in demand for their produce.\r\rThe Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit - LNV), will therefore temporarily underwrite working capital granted to farms and horticultural companies under the the Guarantee for Agricultural SME Credit, (Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten), which is part of the Guarantee SME Loans scheme for small and medium-sized farms and enterprises.\r\rIn this way, the government will act as a guarantor for loans granted to farms. The government seeks to ensure that the scope of this scheme will be broadened in the short term. Enterprises can seek credit to bridge their troubled times of up to \u20ac15 million, for which the Ministry of LNV will act as guarantor for up to 70%. The credit will be for a maximum of two years. \rThis measure was set to stay into force for three months initially, but the timing for COVID-19-related measures is constantly evolving and this may change.",

Managers of childcare centres and headteachers in primary schools were required to provide a service for children of healthcare personnel, personnel in the transport sector or within other critical society functions. The same applies to children with special care needs that cannot be taken care of when childcare, school or other day care facilities are closed. \r\rThe emergency response committee considers the following 15 functions to be critical to society: Government and crisis management; Defence; Law and order; Health and care services; Rescue services; IT security in the civilian sector; Nature and environment; Security of supply; Water and wastewater; Financial services; Power supply; Electronic communication services; Transport; Satellite-based services; Pharmacies.",

This is part of the package of national measures taken to mitigate effects of COVID-19.\rIt should be noted that as of April 2020, Parliament and First Chamber have agreed to the package of bills, though in this situation the cabinet did not need to formally wait for agreement in order to enact the measures.  \rIt has been introduced as bunch of emergency solutions specifically to combat or cushion the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. The measure is for 3 months, but there is budget available to extend it for other 3 months. More specifically this measure is aimed at providing the enterprise with budget to pay their costs. The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) till the pandemic is under control.",

These enterprises are eligible to receive a one-time government subsidy of \u20ac4,000, and in general consist of businesses that are directly, negatively affected by the government\u2019s measures. This includes enterprises that were forced to close doors or could not operate fully because of the government\u2019s corona measures.\r\rThe main selection criteria is SBI codes, the Dutch equivalent of NACE codes. Currently this includes more sectors and sub-sectors than can be noted down here. The sectors included is adapted regularly, by the Ministry since also enterprises that were not obliged to close doors were hit hard such as small fashion shop, so these enterprises were included at a later stage and the ministry announced that the list is not complete yet (13 April 2020). Indeed, this list seems to be evolving and expanding as the crisis continues and future prognoses start to be developed.",

However, the cultural and creative sector, especially badly hit, expressed concern that more was needed for its support. Museums, cultural institutes, events, performances and performers voiced concerns that the crisis could mean that many would have to close their doors for good. Beyond the fact that many people simply cannot attend events, performances, of cultural institutes and this meaning a loss of income, there is also a seasonality to the sector (with many events taking place in the spring and summer). These developments have led to extra measures being taken. On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture, and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The package of measures announced contain a series of specific measures for different groups within the sector.\r\r* Museums subsidized by the government may delay the payments of their rents by three months to give them some financial breathing room.\r* Easing of the heritage laws: heritage institutes are being given more time to prepare their annual reports and annual financial accounts. Instead of submitting their accounts on 1 April, they may now do so by 1 June 2020 instead.\r* Subsidies to cultural institutes will be paid out by the government and there is an easing of the rule that subsidies are reduced if planned performance targets are not met by the institutes. \r\rThis also applies to subsidies to specific projects and initiatives; subsidies will still be paid even if certain planned targets are not met. The six main national cultural funds will also help to implement the measures above and so doing, help the cultural institutes those respective funds support.\r\rThe measure applies to enterprises as well as institutes. Most cultural institutes are not enterprises in fact but the sector has many self-employed and freelancers.",

Recognizing the fact that these are entrepreneurs who in many cases own pledged real estate or they do not have enough insurance in the form of real estate and movable property, as an additional benefit the approval will be granted for loans with minor requirements for classic collateral that will replace the insurance policies on behalf and on account The Republic of Croatia issued by HBOR or by the Croatian Small Business, Innovation and Investment Agency (HAMAG-BICRO) guarantees.\r\rRecognizing the fact that these are entrepreneurs who in many cases own pledged real estate or lack sufficient insurance in the form of real estate and movable property, as an additional convenience, it is possible to approve loans with smaller requirements for classic collateral, which will replace the insurance policies issued by the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development or guarantees of the Croatian Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments (HAMAG-BICRO). \r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The signed agreement stipulates that the Ministry of Tourism will provide funds in the amount of HRK 26 million (\u20ac 3.47) for interest rate subsidies of up to two percentage points for crediting the liquidity of entrepreneurs in tourism activities whose business suffers because of the COVID-19. \r\rThe funds are intended for subsidised lending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises with registered accommodation activities (hotels, resorts, camps, other accommodation), food and beverage service activities (restaurants, catering, other food preparation and service activities), renting water transport vehicles and travel agencies and tour operators. The loan application will be submitted directly to the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which will also grant the funds for up to five years with the possibility of using the grace period of up to one year. This COVID-19 measure for SMEs in the tourism industry is implemented as a temporary measure under the Working Capital Lending Program and applies to requests received at HBOR by 31 December 2020 or until the use of secured funds. There is no right to credit, but HBOR makes a separate decision on each claim.\r\rThe interest rate, thanks to subsidy funds, can be zero percent for the repayment period of up to three years, and in the fourth and fifth repayment years the interest rate can be 1.5 percent (the interest rate depends on state aid regulations). The minimum loan amount that can be applied for is EUR 100 thousand and the highest is limited to EUR 1.25 million in HRK equivalent. The funds can be used to finance salaries, overheads and other basic operating expenses, preparation of the tourist season, and settlement of liabilities to suppliers and other expenses, except for credit obligations to commercial banks, other financial institutions or VAT liabilities.",

As part of these measures, the Revenue service operates a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The scheme enables employees whose employers are affected by the pandemic to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system. The scheme is expected to last 12 weeks from 26 March 2020.\r\rThe scheme was introduced as part of the terms of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020.\r\rOn Wednesday 15 April, the Minister for Finance announced further updates to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.

Provided the employer meets certain conditions and, subject to the levels of pay made to employees, the employer may be eligible for the scheme for some, or all of its employees.\r\rThe employer includes the subsidy as part of the employees\u2019 wages in addition to any amount that the employer would otherwise be able to pay. The subsidy element on the employee\u2019s payslip is indicated as a payment described as \u201cGovCov19 WageSub\u201d.  \r\rA subsidy of 85% is payable for employees whose net weekly income does not exceed \u20ac412. \rA subsidy of 70% is payable for those whose net weekly pay was previously no more than \u20ac500 but less than \u20ac586, with a cap of \u20ac410.\r\rTo qualify for the Scheme, employers must be experiencing significant negative economic disruption due to COVID-19, be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Revenue, a minimum of a 25% decline in turnover and be unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully. They must also retain their employees on the payroll.\r\rThe scheme is confined to employees who were on the employer\u2019s payroll as at 29 February 2020, and for whom a payroll submission was made to Revenue in the period from 1 February 2020 to 15 March 2020.",

This decision was taken _\u201chaving regard to the novel set of arrangements surrounding the re-opening of the economy, as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close\u201d.__\r\rIbec welcomed the extension. Chief Executive Danny McCoy said: \u201cThe extension of the TWSS scheme until August will provide confidence to employers and employees, helping vulnerable firms to stay afloat and keeping their employees engaged whilst protecting the incomes of individuals. \r\rCompanies were also asked to review their eligibility for the scheme. Where a business, after reviewing its position and the economic impact of the pandemic, considers that it did not meet the eligibility criteria but had reasonable grounds for assuming it would, it should immediately cease claiming the subsidy for the extended scheme. Revenue will require evidence of the assumptions supporting the original self-assessment of eligibility and, once the basis is reasonable, will not seek to claw-back the subsidy paid for the original period.

This is the rate of payment of Jobseeker's Benefit.\rif they earned \u20ac200 or more a week, the payment won\u2019t change and they will continue to receive \u20ac350 per week.\r\rTo continue receiving this payment, a claimant needs to confirm eligibility by 13 July.\r\rExplaining the change, the Government stated: __\u201cWhen the Pandemic Unemployment Payment was launched in March 2020, it was paid at a flat rate. This meant that everyone who received the payment was getting the same amount of weekly income support. The rate of payment was not based on previous income or the number of hours worked. This meant that everyone who needed income support was able to get it quickly. As a result, some recipients, mainly working a lower number of hours, received a higher amount of income support than from their previous employment. It is important that the social welfare system is fair - that is why changes have been made to the rate of payment. If you receive a lower rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, it will still be greater than the amount you previously earned from your employer.\u201d__",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The Danish government has taken measures to recognize COVID-19 as a work injury, if they are infected at their place of work. Minister of Employment, Peter Hummelgaard, opens the press release about the measure by stating his condolences over a nurse who contracted the virus and died. Thus, especially mentioned are workers in the healthcare sector, who due to their work are close to infected people and therefore are at risk of infection themselves. This means that the workplace is liable for any costs related to the disease, as opposed to the individual themselves. \r\rLegal reference: VEJ nr 9210 af 21/04/2020 (G\u00e6ldende)",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure covers people who are infected by the COVID-19 during their working hours, as a workplace injury, which naturally emphasizes the healthcare sector as a particularly targeted sector, although other sectors are not necessarily excluded. \r\rIt is hard to say how much money is going to be put towards this measure, as the communication in the legal text also notes. The knowledge of the full extent of long-term effects of the COVID-19 virus is so far limited. It will also depend on how intensely sick the worker will become, which has proven to vary quite significantly. \r\r",

It is important to take flexible paths - from management to production and working methods to sales and communication internally and externally. The goal of this initivie is to maintain operations, secure jobs - and at the same time protect the health of customers and employees. For this reason, the regional government of Styria (Land Steiermark, with its support service provider SFG) and  the Chamber of Labour in the region of Styria (AK Steiermark) started their  promotion campaign 'Teleworking! Offensive' retrospectively from 1 March 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The campaign supports the set up of temporary teleworking places financially.  These are investments in information and communication technology for workplaces outside the company location. This includes some hardware and software, the initial start-up and licenses. \r\rFor the incurred expenses, 50% from the regional state, and another 30% from AK Steiermark can be received as non repayable grants. Alternatively, the rent or lease of equipment is supported by covering down payments or costs for a maximum of five months. \r\rCosts for the ongoing operation of internet access, telephone, electricity etc., but also office and business equipment, such as furniture etc. are not covered. \r\rThe maximum eligible costs are \u20ac50,000 per company and \u20ac5,000 per teleworker (on average). The grant volume must be between \u20ac1,000 and \u20ac40,000. In total, funds for supporting 2,300 teleworking jobs have been set up. \r\rEligible are employers in Styria which are classified as SMEs. Excluded are one-person microenterprises, tourism and leisure businesses, nonprofit organisations, healthcare companies and people outside the SFG target group.",

Norges Bank shall advice the Ministry of Finance on the level of the countercyclical capital buffer for banks. The countercyclical capital buffer rate is currently 2.5%. In recent weeks, there has been considerable financial market volatility. \r\rThe outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) and the measures to limit contagion will have a significant negative impact on growth in the Norwegian economy. There is substantial uncertainty about the duration and the consequences of the outbreak, with a risk of a pronounced economic downturn. Norwegian banks are solid. They have sufficient capital to absorb losses in the event of a severe downturn. A tightening of lending standards may, however, amplify the downturn in the economy. Against this background, the Committee has decided to advise the Ministry of Finance to reduce the buffer to 1% with immediate effect. The decision was unanimous.",

As a result of this, parts of the Emergency Powers Act were activated. \r\rOne of the parts that were activated was section 14 of the Act which establishes an obligation to work when requested. \r\rAt the time of writing, the obligation to work covers healthcare professionals only. This was done in order to secure functioning of the healthcare system and an adequate level of labour force in the sector. ",

Health care professionals who are caregivers to a child or other person cannot be obliged to work. \r\rPublic employment and business services (TE-services) are resposible for organising this measure and they create a database of eligible health care professionals. They will consult employers regarding their need for extra labour force. \r\rDuration of work obligation is maximum two weeks long and it can be renewed once. Salaries are paid in accordance with collective agreements. \r\rIt is also important to point out that obliging health care professionals to work is treated as last resort and it shall be used only when other options such as regular recruitment are not enough to secure functioning of the health care system. \r\r",

In this context, the Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth (BMAFJ) issued decrees clarifying exceptions to these rules.",

While rules on the daily maximum working time, duration of extended service hours, maximum number of extended service hours, and maximum weekly working hours in individual weeks will not apply in these cases, the average weekly working time can only be increased with written approval by the employee.\r\rIn a decree from 16 April 2020, and applicable as of 11 April, it was also clarified that rules on driving and rest periods stemming from (EC) No 561/2006 will be adjusted. Daily driving time has been increased to 11 hours, weekly driving time to 60 hours, and the sum of driving time in two consecutive weeks to 100 hours.

Mainly due to an undersupply of dwellings, house prices and rents are comparatively among the highest in Europe. Rents or mortgage payments are the largest proportion of income people in Ireland spend. The job or income losses due to the pandemic situation has aggravated this crisis, increasing the difficulty many people face with keeping up with mortgage and rent payments. At the same time, the possibility to find new accommodation is reduced in times of the public health policy with social distancing. As part of its package of 'Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020' the Irish government therefore introduced restrictions on evictions and rent freezes for landlords.",

Renters may not be evicted from their home, or \r2. Be served a notice of termination by their landlord. Notices of termination which the renter had received prior to the emergency period are frozen for the duration of the emergency (3 months).\r3. It is also prohibited for landlords to increase rents.\r\rAll types of rentals are included, such as shared accommodation with the landlord, student accommodation and \u2018digs\u2019 type accommodation where meals are provided.\r\rRenters shall continue to pay rent and continue to follow any rules as part of their tenancy.\r\rRenters having difficulties to pay their rents should contact their landlords and possibly agree on a reduced amount for the duration of the emergency measures.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Renault Trucks' managers have agreed to reduce their remuneration in short-time working, in order to provide better compensation for other employees, which constitutes a \"solidarity agreement\" in the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic. Workers and technicians in short-time working will thus be paid 92% of their net salary, instead of the 84% provided for by the legal system. This is made possible by the solidarity of managers on partial unemployment, whose net pay will increase from 100% to 92%.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Applicable until July 3, 2020, this agreement was put in place, thanks to the solidarity of managers and an additional contribution from the company, to erase the disparities in compensation between the different categories of employees, resulting from the legal provisions and the collective agreement of the Metallurgy. The agreement brings the remuneration of all employees to 92% of their usual net remuneration. According to the President of Renault Trucks France, \"this agreement makes it possible to treat all employees fairly during this unprecedented period of crisis. It offers each employee who wishes to do so, the opportunity to approach 100% of his or her remuneration through the use of days off, while safeguarding the future of the company. In addition to the solidarity contribution of the employees, the company's contribution amounts to 8% of the payroll\". \r\rIn detail, on a voluntary basis, it is possible for all employees on short-time work to give 1.6 days for every 20 days they are unemployed to the company in order to keep their full pay. \rThis agreement also secures the maintenance of individual salary increases with effect from 1 April 2020 and the payment of the profit-sharing bonus (prime d'int\u00e9ressement) in June. The company will limit mandatory leave during the period of partial employment to a maximum of 5 days in 2020.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In total, Renault Trucks employs around 7,500 employees (excluding consultants and temporary workers) in France. The agreement applies to this entire workforce. A large majority of them are on short-time working. 700 out of 4,500 employees are teleworking. ",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "On 7 April 2020, the management of PSA Automobiles signed an agreement with the CFDT, CFTC, CFE-CGC and FO trade unions to \"guarantee the best level of protection for employees\" in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three axes are planned to achieve this objective: \r\r* the creation of a \"social solidarity\" mechanism to supplement the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity situations; \r* the possibility of adapting the programming of holidays in each establishment; \r* the implementation of a reinforced protocol of barrier gestures. \r\rThe agreement is applicable until  31 October 2020. The provisions concerning the creation of a solidarity fund will cease on 30 April 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The main content of the measure consist of:\r\r1. **Solidarity Fund**\rSince March 16, 2020, all the activities of the group's industrial and commercial system have been stopped, which has led the company to place the vast majority of staff under the partial activity regime\", according to the agreement, which emphasizes that managers or technicians on fixed-days contracts already benefit from contractual provisions allowing them to maintain their remuneration in the event of partial unemployment. In order to enable all professional categories (employees, workers and technicians managers on lump-sum hours) to benefit from guaranteed remuneration for the period from 16 March to 30 April, the agreement sets up a solidarity fund. The fund will be financed by the payment of two days' leave for managers and one day for workers and technicians. Employees will be able to voluntarily pay the remainder of their paid leave that could not be used before 31 May 2020. \rFor its part, PSA Automobiles undertakes to top up the days paid into the fund by 40%. These payments should make it possible to maintain employees' remuneration for a full month for 100% of the workforce. In the event that the partial activity is extended to all or part of the company's establishments, priority will be given to voluntary payments. If necessary, an additional number of days may be deducted. This may be done by half-day (excluding paid holidays) \"to adjust as best as possible to the gradual takeover of the sites\", up to a limit of 0.5 days for workers and technicians and one day for managers.\r\r2. **Arrangement of paid holidays**\rThe agreement takes into account Order No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020 allowing for the adaptation of the terms and conditions for taking paid holidays. Thus, each head of establishment will be able to impose the taking of six working days of leave during the period of partial activity, from 7 April to 31 October 2020. This week of paid leave may be taken either consecutively if the site's activity has been completely suspended, or non-consecutively if the site's activity is partially maintained.\r\rWith regard to the setting of the weeks of paid summer holidays, each head of establishment will also be able to adjust their positioning, provided that each employee is guaranteed at least 12 consecutive working days over the period between 1 July and 31 August. In this context, the agreement provides for priority in the choice of dates for employees whose spouses cannot change their departure dates, for single-parent families, and for employees working 100% during the period of partial activity in their establishment. The latter will also be able to keep the previously set dates, or take three consecutive weeks of leave. In addition, their unused leave balance as of May 31, 2020 may exceptionally be carried forward until December 31, 2020. Finally, the agreement specifies that all employees who have not been able to take their remaining paid leave before May 31, 2020, due to the resumption of activity or the needs of the establishments, will be able to take these days until July 31, 2020.\r\r3. **An enhanced security protocol**\rThe agreement recalls that, since the start of the health crisis at COVID-19, PSA Automobiles has adopted a reinforced health protocol of barrier gestures (wearing of masks on site, respect of distances with floor markings, ventilation of work spaces, longer break times for hand washing, etc.). Currently being rolled out at all industrial, commercial, service and engineering sites, these measures are subject to internal audits and assessment by health and safety committees to ensure their \"perfect\" implementation. A presentation of the audit reports as well as a field trip with members of the staff representative bodies will make it possible to share these conclusions, to assess their content and to correct, if necessary, the measures taken locally. In addition, management undertakes to implement communication and awareness-raising actions associated with the deployment of the enhanced security protocol.",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Royal Decree Law 7/2020 of 12 March establishes that companies related to the tourism sector are allowed to reduce the payment to the social security for the discontinous open-ended (seasonal) employment contracts by 50%, as long as they keep these employees during the months from February to June.\r\rThese bonuses may be applied to all types of contingences for which companies pay contributions (unemployment, vocational training, common contingences).\r\rConcerning the scope of the measure, only companies engaged in the tourism sector are allowed to these rebates, as well as to those in the commerce and hotel industry. The rebates are nationally applied except in Balearic and Canary Islands during the months of February and March 2020, since other mitigation measures were adopted in 2019 to alleviate the effects of the opening of insolvency proceedings of the Thomas Cook business group. \r\rLater in April 2020, the government has adopted a new measure addressing these types of special employment contracts mainly used in the tourism sector. These employees may access unemployment benefits in the context of ERTEs - temporary employment reduction schemes -, as when the COVID-19 crisis broke out, many of these workers had not taken up their posts. With this measure, they may have a 90-day benefit even if they have consumed their unemployment right or have not contributed enough time to be entitled to. \r\r",

In particular, employers may reduce the uninterrupted rest periods, both daily and weekly. In normal circumstances, they must amount to 11 and 35 hours, respectively. In current circumstances, they can be cut down to 8 and 32 hours respectively. Yet, the shortened hours of rest must be returned to employees within eight weeks at the longest. Another possibility given by the Special Act is to introduce an equivalent working time system with number of daily working hours increased to 12. Longer hours on certain days must be compensated be shorter hours on other days, so the total working time is balanced within the period of 12 months. \r\rIn addition, the employer may introduce less favourable working conditions than those stipulated by the Labour Code.  \rIn order to legally use those options, employers have to meet the following conditions:\r\r1. experience decrease in sales by at least 15% experienced over two consecutive months after 1 January 2020 (the reference period comprised the same two months of the previous year) due to COVID-19 outbreak;\r2. experience decrease in sales by at least 25% experienced on a month-to-month basis after 1 January 2020 (no specific reason required);\r3. have had all public dues and social security contributions duly paid.\r\rIn all aforementioned cases the employer must obtain consent of the onsite employee representation, either company-level trade unions or in the absence of such, with employee represenatives elected in a 'way usual for the employer', in line with the Clause 23/1a of the Labour Code.\r",

This is called the degressivity of unemployment benefits. The measure suspends this degressive element of unemployment benefits for all unemployed in Belgium.\r\rMore specifically, the phase or sub-phase of the compensation period in which the person concerned finds himself on 1 April 2020 will be extended by three months.\r\rThis also applies to persons applying for benefits during the months April to June 2020.

All 950,000 Viennese households are going to receive a voucher by post. One-person households receive a \u20ac25 voucher, households with more people receive a voucher worth \u20ac50. The vouchers can be redeemed in Viennese restaurants, pubs and cafes participating in the scheme.

The service voucher sector and its employees are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the Corona crisis. The nature of their jobs makes it difficult to maintain distance from their clients (who are probably at home due to the quasi lockdown). The remuneration in the sector is fairly low in general. If employees have to make use of temporary unemployment, which is a percentage of their wage, this could lead to financial problems for the employees.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Walloon government has planned to increase the hourly allowance from 1 to 31 May in certain cases. For hours without services provided: all companies can claim an aid of \u20ac18 per hour per worker not benefiting from temporary unemployment (all requests will be processed on the basis of \u20ac18 instead of \u20ac14).\r\rFor hours with services provided: only companies with a maximum of 250 workers under a service voucher contract (declared to Sodexo during the first quarter of 2020) will be able to benefit from the reimbursement amounting up to \u20ac27 instead of \u20ac23.86 .\rThis reimbursement value applies for services which took place in the month of May.\r\rBrussels has also implemented some additional support measures specifically for the service voucher sector.\r\rThe automatic granting of flat-rate aid in the form of a lump sum of \u20ac4,000 to recognised service voucher companies.\r\rOn condition that they submit an application: the possibility for service voucher companies to financially support their employees who were placed in temporary unemployment as a result of Covid-19 measures. In particular, an additional \u20ac2.50 gross per declared hour of temporary unemployment\r\rTemporary increase of the amount of the regional intervention by \u20ac2 per service voucher offered at the issuing company for reimbursement.\r\rFlanders: From 16 March to 19 April, the regional contribution will be increased by \u20ac8.64. This means \u20ac23 instead of \u20ac14.36 per voucher. This increase in payment for the service voucher companies has to make up for the additional costs they have to provide protective materials for their personnel.\r\r\r",

The costs for the deployment of armed forces and civil servants are born by the company, full costs were charged (including material and administrative expenses). Hourly rates differ according to the status and military rank of the army personnel and range from \u20ac 10.20 (for persons doing their basic, compulsory military training) to \u20ac34 (sergeant/corporal). Those rates were fixed around two decades ago. In total, costs of \u20ac1 million were estimated for the Post AG. The personnel costs were paid to the armed forces, while the soldieres themselves received their regular monthly incomes.\r\rBy mid-May at least 79 employees of one major logistical center of the Austrian Post in Hagenbrunn, Lower Austria, have been tested positive for coronavirus and 30% of employees were on sick-leave. Another case of outbreak concerns a postal distribution center in Inzersdorf, Vienna, where 72 employees were tested positive. In both cases, contract tracing showed a link to the deployment of workers from a temporary work agency - some of which had been brought in shared buses to their workplace. \r\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Management from the Post had therefore requested help from the armed forces. \r\rThe site was first disinfected by specialists from the Austrian armed forces team. About 280 soldiers and civilian servants were be deployed to replace the workforce for about two weeks in the sorting of the parcels and loading of truck in the Hagenbrunn center. \r\r250,000 parcels have piled up in the two logistics centers in the meantime.\r\rVienna City Councilor Peter Hacker, responsible for public health, confirmed the city of Vienna would take a closer look at the subject of temporary agency work and precarious employment in Vienna. In order to ensure continuity of business, management of the Post requested support. \r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The federal army took stock after the two-week deployment in Hagenbrunn: the soldiers had unloaded and loaded around 1.5 million parcels from containers since May 16 and prepared them for further delivery for the mail delivery staff. 29,000 working hours were worked. Up to 330 soldiers and civil servants from the armed forces base as well as soldiers from the NBC defense were on duty day and night and worked in three shifts. Out of a total of 29,000 hours, around 3,700 were carried out by the NBC defense force to protect logisticians.\r\rAround 33,000 working hours were worked in Inzersdorf, and in total, 1,050,000 parcels were dealt with. Up to 290 soldiers and civilian staff from the armed forces, NBC defence and the army base were deployed there. To minimise the risk of infection, the Army took sophisticated security precautions: All employees deployed were specially instructed in the procedures and protective measures before starting work, and throughout the logistics centre they were wearing mouth and nose protectors, gloves and safety shoes. In addition, separate recreation and sanitary areas were defined for the soldiers and civilian employees on site. Thus, there was no contact with the postal employees. In order to avoid mixing and to keep possible infection at a minimum, the soldiers were also divided into working groups. If one soldier had tested positive, only one group and not the entire shift would have been cancelled.",
            "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The company level trade union Post and Telecommunications Services Union (GPF) criticised the - in their view too extended - use of temporary agency workers and argued that the Post should seek to resort exclusively to permanent workers in non-peak times. Both social partners representing temporary work agencies and their workers (WKO, representing temporary work agencies in the trade association of commercial service providers) and the union section representing the Temporary Employment Agency in the PRO-GE union, in a joint statement demanded that temporary agency work should not become the pawn in political debates.

The Corona parental leave can be granted for 20% or 50% of full-time working-time. This law was voted on the 2 May and is applicable retro-actively to 1 May and covers the month of May and June. The reference is the arr\u00eat\u00e9 royal n\u00b0 23 du 13.05.2020 taken under article 5, \u00a71, 5\u00b0, of the law of  27 Mars 2020 with respect to the special measures to be taken to fight the coronavirus COVID-19 (II).

To benefit from the 20% reduction the parent should work full-time and to benefit from the 50% reduction the parent should work at least 75% of a full-time.  If an employed parent wishes to reduce their work by 100% or 10% they should apply for the traditional parental leave,  self-employed parents however can apply for a 100 percent reduction of work via the Corona parental leave.\r\rParents that have worked for one month in the private sector or one day in the public sector are eligible for the Corona parental leave. Parents that are self-employed as main activity are also eligible, but not if they are benefiting from the Bridge benefit (see elsewhere in the database).\r\rThe flat-rate benefit is 25% higher than the benefit for the traditional parental leave, for example \u20ac149,60 for a 20% reduction  as compared to \u20ac119,68 for the traditional parental leave for employed parents.

Many factories had to close for several weeks. Working conditions in industrial meat factories have been subject of political debate before, but shortcomings in occupational health and safety, infection prevention and health protection standards, and the resulting high number of infections, now have led to the implementation of new regulations in the meat industry. This followed a debate in the German parliament and a meeting of the responsible minister with industry representatives. New regulations are to be be put in law and the competent authorities will enforce them more vigorously. ",

Contract workers and the leasing of temporary workers will no longer be permitted. Artisanal businesses will be exempted from this regulation;\r* The level of fines imposed for contravention of the Working Time Act is to be doubled to \u20ac30,000;\r* The government will also examine ways of obliging companies to ensure compliance with minimum standards in workers' accommodation;\r* The financial and legal basis of the 'Fair Mobility' project is to be ensured on a permanent basis so that foreign workers are informed in their own language about their rights and about pertinent regulations in Germany",

The allowance is available to every mother and father. Three foms exist; a basic scheme (first 14 months after birth) Elterngeld Plus and the Partnerbonus. The two latter forms are available in case of part time work and in case of both parents involving in care work for at least some few months.  \r\rFor many parents, the COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainties about parental allowance. Parents in systemically relevant professions are needed at their workplace and have to work more hours than usual, while others are free or in short-time work and at risk to run into economic difficulties while receiving parental allowance. For this reason, the government made changes to the existing law. ",

Parents who cannot stay at home or work part time because they work in systemically relevant sectors and professions may postpone their parental allowance (basic scheme) months until the child's 14th month of life, until June 2021 at the latest. The months taken later do not reduce the amount of the parental allowance for another child. \r\rThe actual working time of parents during the Covid 19 pandemic has no impact on their eligibilty for the partnership bonus; working part-time is no longer a requirement.\rIncome replacement benefits that parents receive as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic - such as short-time work allowances or compensation for income losses - do not reduce the amount of parental allowances. \r\u00a0In order to compensate for disadvantages in the later parental allowance calculation, expectant parents can also exclude these months from the parental allowance calculation",

In this regard, it is considered an accompanying measure to facilitate resuming of business activity according to the de-escalation plan approved by the government. \r\r* In doing so, the partial unemployment benefit received by the employees is also extended and the time consumed in this situation will not be deducted from future entitlements to unemployment protection. This protection is extended until 31 December for seasonal workers under specific employment contracts in the tourism sector. \r\r* Employers will be exempted to contribute to the social security when they start to operate again, assuming that the resumption of the business activity will not be immediate. State funds 85% of due employers' social security contributions in May and 70% in June for firms returning to work with less than 50 employees and 60% and 45% respectively for those with more than 50 employees. These percentages will be lower in the case that the firms partially return to activity with only part of the staff. \r\r*The obligation to keep all workers and do not make any redundancies within six months once returning to business activity is relaxed for the tourism sector and for those companies at risk of insolvency or bankruptcy. \r\r\r\r",

This is a voluntary action coordinated by companies and startups associated with OK!Thess and the broader technological innovation ecosystem of  the city of Thessaloniki in Greece. The  OK!Thess community includes the city of Thessaloniki, universities, the association of industries in the Northern part of Greece, association of exporters, innovation bodies, association of information technology businesses, etc. The 'COVID-19 Response Greece' consists of a team of volunteers with scientific, research background and start-uppers who offer solutions to the problems and needs arising from the pandemic. The aim of the initiative is to provide  through research, design and manufacture  free delivery of products and services such as face shields, masks, ventilators, surgical masks, on-line self-assessment monitoring systems for people suspected of having COVID-19 symptoms,etc.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Within just days of launching,the 'COVID-19 Response Greece' initiative managed to mobilise companies and produce two types of face shields and face masks. The team designed and manufactured the face shields  for free and made the design openly (under the terms of Creative Commons (4.0 International License) Attribution-Non Commercial), accessible to any companies wishing to produce them on the condition that no profits should be sought. It is clearly indicated on the 'COVID-19' Response Greece' website that 'face shields may be made available for free or at a reasonable price to cover the cost of manufacturing. In the latter case, the manufacturer must first acquire a license, the purpose of which is to exclude the possibility of profiteering'. The research and development for the shields has been undertaken by  Thodoris Aleksandros Marioglou (Project:Veltio), Harry Yeremtzes (AidPlex), Dimitris Moustakas (AidPlex), Kostas Paraskevas (AidPlex)  with support by the initiative.\r\r\rAdditionally, the team and members of the community conducted research and development for surgical masks and  non-invasive mechanical ventilation devices for patients as well as online self-assessment & remote monitoring systems for people who have potential COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of the community is to respond and mobilize quickly through research and design of practical solutions to critical problems, free delivery of products and services, open access and open innovation.The team consists of 270 volunteers, 21 organisations and has produced 8 projects.Several companies and startups involved in the OK!Thess initiative participate in the coordination of this voluntary initiative. The main objective of th OK1!Thess group is to ensure an effective innovation ecosystem in the Thessaloniki geographical area",

The company points out that flexibility has always been high on their list of priorities, both in relation to customers and project work, as well as in the corporate culture itself. According to Combis CEO the __'employees want higher mobility, flexibility and the ability to work from any location at any time, as well as from any device. Technology (and a good attitude) enables all of the above, so it is natural that ICT companies lead these changes, and transfer their experiences, new solutions and good practices to other companies'__.\r\r",

From mid-June 2020, Combis employees, can choose between several working models which include different combinations of days spent working in the office and those working from home under the condition that working from home cannot make up more than 50% of the time.The new, flexible model has several options, so each employee can decide what suits her or him best in order to balance professional and personal life as successfully as possible.\r. \r",

            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The scheme envisages the provision of state co-financing for wages according to reduced working hours.The measure is designed to help out employers who are forced to reduce working hours due to operating difficulties and a drop in business activities by more than 20%. The new support measure, to be in force from 1 July to 31 December 2020 will target firms from all sectors that have 10 or more employees having a revenue decline of at least 20% for the comparable month 2020 to 2019.\u00a0For employers in the manufacturing industry a drop of less than 20% is allowed.\r\rDepending on the needs of the employer, the state can co-finance wages for working time reductions between 10% to 50% of working hours per month. That means from 2.5 working days, up to 50% of the fund of monthly hours. Therefore, the co-financing of workers can be between HRK 400 and 2,000 (\u20ac53 to \u20ac264). In other words, the financial aid can be given to companies that would work 36 hours a week and shorter, but not shorter than 20 hours a week. This support will not be available for teleworkers.\r\rThe government intends to reduce the administrative burden for application to a minimum. \r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The estimated value of the investment in the new scheme will reach some HRK 3 billion (\u20ac397 million) by the end of 2020, and will be financed mostly by the European Commission's temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) program.

They have been issued by the Minister of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance with the Decrees 269, 270, 271, 272 and 273 of the Law for Emergency Measures for the Confrontation of the Pandemic of COVID-19 (2020). ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure has the following contents: \r\r* The first scheme targets hotel and accommodation units that have not been reactivated after the closure due to the pandemic or which foresee to have a 40% reduction of their turnover. The main obligation of the participating businesses is to collaborate with the Deputy Ministry of Tourism and provide offers for the attraction of domestic tourism. A special unemployment allowance will be paid for 90% of the employees and the business will receive 60% of the value of the insurable units of employees. \r* The second scheme targets businesses connected with the tourist industry or affected from tourism with more than 55% loss turnover. Participating businesses that will reopen and are staffed with up to three employees will receive a special unemployment benefit for 100% of the employees and businesses that remain closed will receive unemployment benefit for 60% of their employees. Businesses with more than three employees which reopen, will receive the benefit for 60% of their employees and those that will not reopen will receive the benefit for 80% of their employees. \r* The third scheme targets specific economic activities with a reduction in turnover of more than 40% in June and July 2020 covering 45% of salaries and a reduction in turnover of more than 35% in August covering 40% of salaries.\r* The fourth scheme targets businesses that are unable to resume operation due to decrees issued by the Ministry of Health and will cover 60% of the wages of all employees of businesses staffed up to nine persons and 90% of employees of businesses employing more than nine persons. \r\rThe basic requirement for participation in the four schemes is that no employee has been dismissed since 1 March 2020 and up until 31 October 2020. The maximum amount to be paid is \u20ac1,214 and minimum \u20ac360.\r\rThe fifth scheme targets the unemployed, who have exhausted their right to receive an unemployed benefit. Beneficiaries will be eligible to receive  a lump sum of \u20ac360. ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The budget of the bundle of the five new measures is \u20ac150 million. According to the joint press conference of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurances around 50,000 beneficiaries are expected for the five schemes for the period 13 June to 12 October 2020. ",
            "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners - trade unions and employers\u2019 organisations - participated in the structural dialogue for the design of the measure following the invitation of the Minister of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurances.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The first measures to help entrepreneurship during the corona crisis were more focused on maintaining jobs. In business, however, there is also a need for spaces that entrepreneurs rent to a significant extent from the owners. This measure in the form of a law is aimed at helping entrepreneurs who rent business premises and for which they have to pay rent. The state subsidy will go to pay part of the rent for the use of the premises, which were closed due to a government regulation for the spread of coronavirus.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "First, there is a negotiation between the landlord and the tenant about the amount of discount. The state pays the landlord a subsidy in the same amount as he gives the entrepreneur a discount on rent. The ceiling is 50% of the amount of rent for the period of difficult use of space. In such a case, the landlord will forgive half of the rent and the other half of the rent will be refunded by the state. The tenant for the period will not pay anything for renting the premises. If the landlord and the tenant agree on a lower discount (e.g. 30%), the state will contribute equally (30%) and the rest (40%) must be paid by the entrepreneur renting the premises. In this case, the tenant can spread the payment of unpaid rent in instalments over 48 months. During the payment, the landlord is not entitled to unilaterally increase the amount of rent. The assistance provided to the tenant is financed from the resources of the state budget of the Slovak Republic. The maximum amount of the grant for one applicant is \u20ac800,000. The subsidy covers only rent, not energy supply.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Based on a mutual agreement, the renter will ask the landlord to submit an application for a rent subsidy for the period of difficult use. The application is submitted by the landlord on behalf of the tenant, on the landlord's own account. The application must be signed on behalf of both parties, by all authorized persons of both entities, with a qualified electronic signature. The application is submitted to the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic in the period from 23 June 2020 to 30 November 2020. The total amount of available resources provided by the Ministry of Economy for this purpose is \u20ac 200 million (for about 70,000 to 100,000 applicants). The funds come from national sources.",

On this legal basis, the Slovak Guarantee and Development Bank (SZRB) provides an Operating Loan called ENTREPRENEUR 2020 to support the maintenance of operations and employment in small or medium-sized enterprises, with the possibility of obtaining financial assistance from the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic. An operating loan takes the form of a \"loan guarantee\" and a \"loan interest payment\".",

The maximum maturity of the loan is 3 years from the date of the first drawdown; repayment of principal and interest may be deferred for a period of 12 months from the date of the first drawdown of the loan.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "The second and the third COVID-19 laws bring a lot of measures to get sectors, most hit by the epidemics, back to the normal. Measures include various projects: \r\r* Less rigid requirements for construction plans to boost the construction sector.\r* Tourist vouchers to help the tourist and hospitality sector. \r* State loans and grants to compensate the loss of income.\r* Financial incentives (loans and grants) to generate new investments and creation of new jobs. \r* Less rigid requirements for construction plans in agriculture and favorable agricultural rents (discounted or free of charge). \r\rMeasures particularly address these sectors: tourism and hospitality, road transport, agriculture, manufacturing and others.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The second COVID-19 law intends to boost investments in the construction sector by an accelerated procedure in obtaining building permits. The law requires, for example, more rigid criteria from environmental organisations (at least 50 active members, 3 full-time employees holding a diploma in natural sciences, \u20ac10,000 of assets in the last three years) to participate in the procedure.\rThe second and third COVID-19 laws help the tourist and hospitality sectors with tourist vouchers. Tourist agencies and organisers of sports events may issue vouchers instead of reimbursement for unrealised travels or events. Payment moratorium expires in 24 months. In order to revitalise the tourist sector, each permanent resident of Slovenia gets tourist vouchers (adults \u20ac200, minors \u20ac50), valid until 31 December 2020, to be spent on accommodation. The government estimates the cost of tourist vouchers at \u20ac345 million, while the multiplier effects are estimated to be \u20ac172 million.\rState grants and loans co-finance the loss of income in tourism and hospitality, provide support for manufacturing in the affected border areas, encourage digitalisation of companies and development projects. Micro, small and medium-sized companies as well as large companies affected by the pandemic are eligible. On top of this, the state gives \u20ac35 million to companies in the road transport industry, financial aid for managers of ski lifts, ranging from \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac12,200 per lift.\rBusinesses meet less strict requirements for obtaining co-financing of investments until 30 June 2021. The incentives will be granted if the investment creates at least 10 jobs in the manufacturing or service sector, or 3 jobs in research and development within three years after its completion. The minimum threshold for investments is \u20ac12 million in manufacturing, \u20ac3 million in the service sector, and \u20ac2 million in research and development.\rAgricultural businesses may profit from less rigid requirements for building greenhouses, irrigation systems, and plantations until 31 December 2020, subsidies for the exploitation of geothermal energy for farming, or more favorable rents (discounted or free of charge) in agriculture.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "More rigid criteria for environmental organisations raise concern in the public since new rules exclude environmental organisations from the procedure in obtaining the building permit. It is believed that new rules jeopardise the protection of nature. Adoption of this regulation is one of the motives for mass protests held every Friday evening. Ten protests so far gathered from a few thousand to ten thousand persons. Other issues of disputes are corruption in the procurement of security and medical equipment, replacement of some top officials, the extension of the powers of the military, police brutality and others.",
            "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Up to 15 May 2020, social partners communicated with the government mostly by the written proposals. Negotiations between social partners were blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council. On 20 April, trade unions protested against the exclusion of social partners in the preparation of emergency laws. They demanded the reactivation of the Economic and Social Council. The first meeting of the Economic and Social Council was held not before 15 May 2020. Since 15 May, the Council is involved in negotiations about next emergency laws.",

It consists of thirteen measures of which one fourth are designed to support businesses and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), in particular, to obtain liquidity, cover the running operating costs of businesses, stay afloat and avoid dismissals. The Minister of Financed designed the package and it has been approved by the Cabinet.   ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The first measure provides for \u20ac800 million liquidity for the financing of Small and Medium Enterprises with favourable financing conditions and terms. The financing to SMEs will be done through the Cyprus Entrepreneurship Fund (CYPEF) and the bank institutes. Beneficiaries are SMEs with maximum number of employees to be 250 and the maximum amount of loan \u20ac1.5 million that are to be reimbursed over a period of twelve years. Interest rates will be lower than the current rates of banks with the potential of subsidy by the \u2018Scheme of Interest Rates Subsidy\u2019. \r\rThe second measure, the \u2018Scheme of Interest Rates Subsidy\u2019, aims to improve liquidity for businesses and self-employed confronting sudden lack of liquidity through subsidy of new business loans. Competent and financing authority is the General Accounting Office of the Ministry of Finance. Beneficiaries of the scheme are all undertaking companies in accordance with the EU definition \u2013 very small, small, medium and large enterprises and self-employed - and the aim of the loan shall be the covering of liquidity needs for capital and investment purposes. The maximum interest rates for long is defined to 4.25% and the maximum period of subsidy will be four years. For the first two years the subsidy will be up to 3.5 percentage points and two percentage points for the third and fourth years. \r\rThe third measure of this bundle is a lump sum subsidy targeting self-employed and very small businesses that have partially or fully suspended their activities integrated in the special schemes of the Ministry of Labour between 13 April and 12 May 2020. For businesses employing \r\r* up to one person the lump sum is \u20ac1,250, \r* 2-5 persons \u20ac3,000, \r* 6-9 persons \u20ac4,000 and \r* 10-50 persons \u20ac6,000. \r\rThe purpose of the measure is for the covering of rents, operational expenses and other business debts. \r\rThe fourth measure provides for the reduction of VAT from 9% to 5% for the period 1 July 2020 to 10 January 2020 in the sectors of tourist accommodation and catering. It is expected that the reduction will benefit the sectors that have been mostly affected by the pandemic as well as the businesses and consumers due to the increase of consumer demand.  ",

The amount of state-supported income (SSI), on which the right to social benefits directly depends, has been increased. In accordance with the former procedure, a person was entitled to a social benefit when income per family member did not exceed the amount of the SSI or \u20ac125. From 1 June 2020, persons with an average income per family member of less than 1.1 SSI per month (i.e. \u20ac137.50) will be entitled to the social benefit.\r3. The amount of the social benefit per resident has been increased by \u20ac50 and its amount has been differentiated depending on the length of receiving assistance. The benefit will be paid in the amount of \r\r* up to \u20ac175 (previously - up to \u20ac125) when paid for up to 6 months; \r* \u20ac150 - when paid for 6 to 12 months; \r* and \u20ac137.5 - when paid for more than 12 months.\r\r4. Criteria for granting additional allowance upon employment have been simplified: \r\r* 100% of the social benefit will be paid for the first 3 months, \r* 80% for 4-6 months, and \r* 50% for 7-12 months. \r\r",

According to the survey run by the Croatian Chamber of Economy which covered over 2,700 companies,\u00a095% of companies had reported declines in turnover and 28% had suffered declines of 100%. Three-quarters of the companies surveyed, or 74%, reported drops in production, and a fifth of them, or 21%, had seen their production fall by 100%. Supply chains have also been\u00a0impacted by the outbreak, with 61% of companies reporting problems. Forty-five percent of companies recorded declines in exports and 41% reported falls in imports. In such circumstances it is no wonder that 42% of those polled are considering layoffs and as many as 37% are thinking of closing down. Therefore, special measures were needed for micro-businesses, primarily by co-financing wages and granting them moratoriums on loan repayments. At the session held on June 29, 2020, the Croatian Employment Service Management Board adopted specific measure in this regard related to micro-entrepreneurs.",

Target groups of workers are all insured persons with the eligible employer, regardless of whether they have a permanent or fixed-term employment, including founders, members of the management board, directors, procurators, and business owners. The target group of workers does not include pensioners and foreigners from third countries whose residence and work permits have expired.\r\rEmployers who use measures of the Croatian Employment Service (CES) and other organisations, cannot use both measures at the same time. If more than one business entity has the same founder or owner who individually employs less than 10 employees, and all business entities together have more than 10 employees, the support will not be granted. \r\rEmployers can choose to suspend contractual obligations under active contracts of active labour market policy (ALMP) measures by CES that include the covering the cost of wages. At the end of the period of application of this measure, they will continue to use the ALMP measure in the remaining period. Employers need to prove that in June 2020 they had a decrease in income by at least 50% compared to June 2019, based on the submission of the VAT form for June 2020 and June 2019. If the employer operates for less than 12 months, it is necessary to prove a decrease in turnover by at least 50% in June 2020 compared to February 2020 based on the submission of the VAT form for June and February 2020. \r\rThe monthly amount of the support is HRK 2,000 (\u20ac267) for July 2020 per full-time employee, while for part-time employees it is the proportional according to the contractual number of hours. \r\rThe\u00a0support period is July 2020,\u00a0yet the Administrative Board of the Croatian Employment Service will decide each month on the extension of the measure.

The deferral of annuity payment is approved for a period of 3 to 6 months depending on the reason for requesting the moratorium, starting from the due date of outstanding annuity. \r\rThe decision on approving the moratorium is made by the Bank on the basis of submitted documentation. During the moratorium, a client is not required to pay either principal or interest on the loan. Interest on a loan will be calculated but not immediately charged. Upon expiration of the moratorium, the Bank will allocate interest that has not been collected, but is calculated during the moratorium, to the remaining annuities, until the end of loan repayment. This means that the amount of the existing annuity per loan will be increased for the amount of interest that will be calculated during the moratorium. The loan repayment deadline is extended by as many months as the moratorium has been approved, in order to further facilitate client\u2019s future monthly financial obligation Regarding the COVID-19, the reasons for deferral repayment can be job loss and salary reduction.

The hotels and restaurants have been particularly hit by the lock down. In order to promote their economic recovery, the government proposed a series of legislative measures adopted as a result of the establishment of the state of emergency and applicable on Romanian territory. A tax relief for the payment of the specific tax was offered for the following NACE activities: 5510, 5520, 5530, 5590, 5610, 5621, 5629, 5630. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In April, the GEO 48/2020 stated that taxpayers who were previously obliged to pay a specific tax for certain economic activities for the year 2020, will be exempted for the period in which they had to interrupt the activity totally or partially, during the declared state of emergency. Such taxpayers recalculate the specific tax for 2020 by dividing the annual specific tax by 365 days and multiplying it by the number of days corresponding to the period in the calendar year in which they performed the activity.\r\rIn June 2020, after the expiry of some provisions of GEO 48/2020, the government came with another GEO (99/2020) stating that, for 2020, no specific tax is due for a period of 90 days as of the date of entry into force of GEO 99/2020. The amount due is calculated by dividing the tax by 365 and multiplying the resulting value by 275 (i.e. the difference between 365 days and 90 days). Taxpayers which have ceased their activity, in whole or in part, due to the state of emergency, can similarly recalculate their specific annual tax.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In order to benefit from the above provisions, taxpayers need to fulfill cumulatively the following conditions:\r\r\r* the taxpayers interrupt totally or partially the activity during the state of emergency and hold the certificate for emergency situations issued by the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Business\rEnvironment;\r* they are not insolvent according to the information available on the National Office of the Trade Register website.",

The term of the loan is a minimum of 18 months to a maximum of 48 months. Subject to additional terms and conditions, the term of the loan can be increased up to 72 months. The loan also has a minimum moratorium of six months, with a possibility to extend to one year.

It \"encourages undertakings (including start-ups, family businesses and self-employed) to invest in their business, so as to innovate, expand and develop their operations. Undertakings benefiting from this measure will be supported through a tax credit calculated as a percentage of eligible expenditure and wages costs.\" In order to be eligible for this scheme (since January 2018), applicants must have employed at least one person (full or part time), must not have employed more than 50 full time employees and their turnover did not exceed \u20ac10 Million in the previous fiscal year.\r\rIn view of COVID-19 and the impact it has had upon organisations' cash flows, Government announced that a percentage of these tax credits would be converted into grants. \r\rThe updating of this scheme is in line with scheme's documentation that was issued prior to COVID-19 which states that \"Malta Enterprise Corporation may issue and publish updates to the official Incentive Guidelines covering this aid scheme in terms of Article 8 (3)(a) of the Malta Enterprise Act, Chapter 463 of the Laws of Malta. The Tax Credits for Micro Enterprises and Self-Employed Regulations as subsidiary legislation 463.09 to the Malta Enterprise Act, forms the national legal basis of this aid scheme.\"",

Furthermore, organisations in Gozo, family-run businesses, and those run by female entrepreneurs will receive a grant of \u20ac2,500. Costs covered by this scheme include refurbishment and upgrading of offices & factories, investment in machinery and other assets. In total this measure will provide around \u20ac5 million to small and medium enterprises in our country. \r\rFull guidelines and applications for this scheme are yet to be published. \r\r\r\r",

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "On the 8 July, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced his 'Plan for Jobs' in his Summer Statement to the House of Commons. The plan is focused on boosting economic recovery, following the UK's lockdown and the recent easing of restrictions. The Chancellor described the plan as the 'second phase' of response to the coronavirus crisis and as being about jobs. He began his speech by stating that the government will not accept rising unemployment and that it will do all it can to give 'everyone the opportunity of good and secure work.' The Plan for Jobs has 'a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs', given the 25% contraction in the UK economy in the preceding months and the predictions by the\u00a0Office for Budget Responsibility and Bank of England as to\u00a0significant job losses.\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "These initiatives are aimed at supporting young people, who it is predicted, will be hardest hit by the crisis (the Chancellor reported that the under-25s are two and a half times more likely to work in a sector that has been closed e.g. retail and hospitality).\u00a0The new Kickstart Scheme is thus a\u00a0__'new programme to give hundreds of thousands of young people, in every region and nation of Britain, the best possible chance of getting on and getting a job.'__\r\rUnder the scheme, employers will be directly paid to create new jobs for any\u00a016 to 24-year-old at risk of long-term unemployment.\u00a0These will have to be new jobs, as the\u00a0funding will be conditional on proof that\u00a0these jobs are additional.\u00a0 The jobs will have to be 'decent';\u00a0with a minimum of 25 hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.\u00a0 Employers will also have to provide\u00a0'Kickstarters' with training and support to find a permanent job.\u00a0If employers meet these conditions, the Government\u00a0will pay young people\u2019s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads. Thus, for\u00a0a 24-year-old, the grant will be around \u00a36,500.\r\rEmployers can apply to be part of the scheme from August. There is to be no cap on the numbers of places available and the Chancellor has pledged\u00a0an initial \u00a32 billion, a sum he says will be enough to fund hundreds of thousands of jobs.\r\rThe Government also pledged on the 8 July\u00a0to: \r\r* pay employers \u00a31000 to take on new\u00a0trainees, with triple the number of places;\r* provide \u00a3100 million to create more places on Level 2 and 3 courses, so as to support 18-19-year olds leaving school or college to find work in high-demand sectors like engineering, construction and social care;\u00a0\r* funding for\u00a0new careers advisers to support over a quarter of a million more people; \r* for the next six months, paying employers to create new apprenticeships and paying businesses to hire young apprentices, with a payment of \u00a32000 per apprentice. \r* In addition, there will be a new bonus for businesses to hire apprentices aged 25 and over, with a\u00a0payment of \u00a31,500.\r",

Under the BBLS, businesses will be able to apply for quick and easy-to-access loans between \u00a32,000 and up to 25% of their turnover; the maximum loan available under the Scheme is \u00a350,000. No loan repayments are required for the first 12 months and the government will cover the interest repayments for the same period.\r\rFor those businesses seeking more than \u00a350,000, BBLS is intended to sit alongside the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).   Under CBILS, a participating lender can provide up to \u00a35 million in the form of term loans, overdrafts, invoice finance or asset finance.  Both schemes are operated by the British Business Bank, through accredited lenders\r",

The maximum loan available is \u00a350,000. The government guarantees 100% of the loan and there are\u00a0no fees or interest to pay for the first twelve\u00a0months. After twelve months, the interest rate will be 2.5% a year.\r\rAn SME can apply for the loan if the business: \r\r* is based in the UK\r* was established before 1 March 2020\r* has been adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\r\rSMEs from any sector can apply with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers); public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. \r\rIf a firm is\u00a0already claiming funding under the CBILS (a loan of up to \u00a350,000), then this can be transferred into the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Businesses have until the 4th of November to arrange this with their lender. \r\rThe loan will run for six years\rThe length of the loan is 6 years, but businesses\u00a0can repay early without paying a fee. No repayments will be due during the first 12 months.\r\rThe scheme is being run under the auspices of the British Bank, with eleven\u00a0lenders participating in the scheme (including many of the main retail banks). Businesses\u00a0should approach a suitable lender directly\u00a0via the lender\u2019s website.

The Fund is aimed at\u00a0innovative and high-growth British businesses, to facilitate their ability to\u00a0secure investment during the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 The Fund will be open until September and is delivered in partnership with the British Business Bank. It is part of the raft of financial measures. launched by the government as part of its response to the crisis. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Announced by the Chancellor on the 20th of\u00a0April, the Future Fund issues convertible loans from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a35 million, to innovative UK companies with good potential, that typically rely on equity investment and are currently affected by Covid-19. The government funding is subject to at least equal match funding from private investors.\r\rThese convertible loans may be an option for businesses that rely on equity investment and are unable to access other government business support programmes because they are either pre-revenue or pre-profit.\r\rThe key features of the scheme are as follows. The application process is investor-led. This means an investor, or lead investor of a group of investors, applies in connection with an eligible company. The Future Fund will match up to 100% of the amount provided by investor(s), up to a maximum of \u00a35 million.\u00a0 The Future Fund loan amount provided to the company ranges from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a35 million (this must be at least co-matched by investor capital).\u00a0 Funding must not be used to \r* repay any borrowings;\r* pay any dividends; \r* pay any bonuses; \r* pay any advisory fees. \r\rThe loans will have a minimum of 8% per annum (non-compounding) interest charge applied. This interest will be higher if the company and the investor(s) agree between themselves. Unlike a typical bank loan, the interest is not payable on a monthly basis and instead will accrue until the loan converts. At this point, the interest will either be repaid or convert in equity. The loan will mature after 36 months.\u00a0 The loan cannot be repaid early by the company other than with the agreement of all of the investors.\u00a0 The loans will convert into shares in the company in certain circumstances, including an exit or a new funding round.\r\rIn order to be eligible for the scheme, each of the investor(s) and the company must meet specific criteria.\r\rTo be eligible for the scheme, the company must meet the following criteria:\r\r1. The company must have raised at least \u00a3250,000 in equity from third-party investors in previous funding rounds in the last five years (from 1 April 2015 to 19 April 2020, inclusive).\r2. If the company is a member of a corporate group, it must be the ultimate parent company.\r3. The company does not have any of its shares or other securities listed on a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, a recognised investment exchange and/or any other similar market, stock exchange or listing venue.\r4. The company must be a UK incorporated limited company or be eligible to apply as a non-UK parent company.\r5. The company must have been incorporated on or before 31 December 2019 (or in the case of\u00a0a non-UK jurisdiction company*, this criterion applies only to at least one UK subsidiary operating company).\r6. At least one of the following must be true for the company:\r\r* Half or more employees are UK based\r* Half or more revenues are from UK sales\r\rThe scheme's\u00a0eligibility criteria have been amended to include innovative companies that participate in accelerator programmes based outside the UK.\u00a0 Where before, these companies didn\u2019t qualify because they had to register in an overseas jurisdiction to take part in an accelerator programme, the new criteria means they can now access the fund, providing they meet all other conditions for eligibility.\r\u00a0\rThe scheme is designed by government and delivered by the British Business Bank.\u00a0Initially, \u00a3250 million was made available by the government for investment through the scheme, to be matched by private investors. However, the\u00a0Treasury made clear that the amount could be increased if needed.\u00a0 ",

To make it possible for the many unemployed to acquire new skills and knowledge, the government acted in April on an initiative from the social partners and opened up temporarily to make it easier to study or do training while receiving unemployment benefits. In June, the temporary scheme was extended to last through 31 December 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In March 2020, the social partners suggested that receivers of unemployment benefit should have a right to study while unemployed. The aim was to make the corona crisis an opportunity to raise the competencies of the population. More people could learn to use digital tools, completing upper secondary school or gain vocational skills. To achieve this, the social partners argued, it was necessary that the government relaxed the regulations for unemployment benefits and removed the restrictions that makes it difficult or impossible for employees to combine training with unemployment benefits. A temporary scheme was put in place on 20 April 2020, and gives the unemployed and lay-offs possibility to combine training with unemployment benefits to a greater extent than before. The rules initially applied until 1 September, but was later extended until 31 December 2020.\r\r* Until 31 December 2020, receivers of unemployment benefit do not have to apply to the authority in order to do training or studying during the time they are laid off or unemployed.\r* The scheme is temporary and applies to both those laid off, among whom many will return to their old jobs, and the unemployed who are looking for new jobs.\r* The rules do not apply to students who receive support from the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund.\r* The scheme applies to all types of courses and training including studies where you get credits.\r* The new temporary scheme means that everyone who ticks off for training on the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration\u2019s registration card will be paid unemployment benefits as usual. Previously, one had to apply to combine training with unemployment benefits and get this approved.\r* The requirement to be an active jobseeker and available for a new job applies to everyone who receives unemployment benefits, including the unemployed and laid-off people who are in training. When offered a job before the training is completed, it is up to the individual whether they choose to interrupt the training, or to complete in combination with being at work.",

The NPO Support Fund is intended to support organisations with their own legal personality if they pursue non-profit, charitable or ecclesiastical purposes in accordance with the Federal Tax Code. Political parties and organisations subject to the control of the Court of Audit are excluded. It is planned that the Minister of Finance will provide funds amounting to \u20ac700 million from the COVID-19 crisis management fund for this purpose. \r\rThe following types of organisations affected by the Corona crisis are eligible:\r\r1. Non-profit organisations such as sports, cultural and animal welfare associations\r2. Organisations which are responsible for fire brigade tasks according to state law\r3. Legally recognised churches, religious communities and institutions which have legal personality under state law on the basis of religious law provisions\r",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The aim of the funding is to mitigate the loss of revenue caused by COVID-19 for organisations eligible under the law (i.e. NPO's) by means of grants for eligible costs. The funding consists of two areas:\r\r1. **Reimbursement of the eligible fixed costs**\rSubsidisable fixed costs (rent, insurance, water, sewerage, waste, tax consultant, energy, telco - no personnel costs) will be reimbursed up to 100% for the period from 1 April 2020 to 30 September 2020.\rExceptions: Costs incurred as a result of the Corona crisis will already be subsidised from 10 March 2020, e.g. protective equipment or disinfectants. Expenses for cancelled events must have been incurred before 10 March.\r\r2. **Structural security contribution**\rThe flat-rate contribution to structural securities is intended to cover costs that do not fall under the eligible fixed costs (see above), such as maintenance or servicing costs, and normally amounts to 7% of the income generated in 2019.\r\rThe grant is the sum of eligible costs and the structural support contribution, if this sum does not exceed \u20ac3,000.\r\rIf the sum of eligible costs and the structural support contribution is higher than \u20ac3,000, the maximum grant is the amount of the loss of income.\r\rHow is the loss of income calculated?\rNormally, the difference between the income of the first three quarters of 2019 and the income of the first three quarters of 2020.\r\rApplications can be made from 8 July 2020 until 31 December 2020. The grant is paid up to a maximum of \u20ac2.4 million per organisation. The Austrian Promotional Bank AWS is responsible for processing the applications, and reporting obligations to the National Council are planned.",

In their two-day coalition government meeting on 15 and 16 June, the federal government (consisting of the conservative People's Party \u00d6VP and the Green Party) announced several measures targeted towards boosting the economy, among them one-off payments for unemployed persons and for parents, both in September. The latter are to be supported at the start of the new school year.",

The condition is that they have received unemployment benefit or emergency unemployment assistance for at least 60 days between May and August. Furthermore, a one-off payment of \u20ac360 for each child for who family allowance is drawn, is paid (i.e. this applies generally to all children up to the year in which they turn 19 years and beyond up to 24 years if they are enrolled in education/training, and to 25 in special cases).

Depending on the activity, this includes, for example, the possibilities for home office, redesigning workplaces to maintain a safe distance, installed barriers such as plexiglass walls or the use of personal protective equipment.\r\rThe third COVID-19 Law paved the way for defining specific \"risk groups\", to which further protective measures apply. Employed workers with a very high risk of developing a serious illness if becoming infected with the Corona virus are entitled to work from their home office or to a change in working conditions (meaning that the working conditions must be designed in such a way that infection with COVID-19 is almost impossible, taking into account the way to work). Ultimately, if this is not possible, a paid temporary leave of absence can be obtained with full payment by the employer, who will be reimbursed in full by the social security system for the wage costs (including ancillary wage costs).\r\rAn expert group consisting of three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Nursing and Consumer Protection, one representative from the Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, three representatives from the Medical Association and three representatives from the social security system held several meetings based on previous experience with COVID -19 sufferers in Austria's hospitals and the international scientific results identified the groups of people who could have a higher risk of developing a serious illness. ",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The COVID-19 risk group regulation lists the medical reasons (indications) for belonging to the COVID-19 risk group. Based on these indications, a doctor may issue a COVID-19 risk certificate.\r\rThe main medical indications are:\r\r1. advanced chronic lung diseases that require permanent, daily, dual medication\r2. chronic heart diseases with end organ damage that require permanent therapy, such as ischemic heart diseases and heart failure\r3. active cancer with oncological pharmacotherapy (chemotherapy, biologics) and / or radiation therapy within the past six months, and metastatic cancer even without ongoing therapy\r4. diseases that need to be treated with immunosuppression\r5. advanced chronic kidney disease\r6. chronic liver diseases with organ remodeling and decompensated liver cirrhosis from Childs stage B\r7. pronounced obesity from obesity grade III with a BMI> = 40\r8. diabetes mellitus\r9. arterial hypertension with existing end organ damage, especially chronic heart or kidney failure, or uncontrollable blood pressure adjustment.\r\rThese main medical indications are further divided and described in detail in the regulation.\rIn addition, other, similarly serious diseases with functional or physical limitations can provide special protection through a COVID-19 risk certificate.\r\rMost members of the risk group were identified through their medication via their health insurance. They received letters by their social security institution after the legal provisions came into force in May. Furthermore, an individual risk analysis can be obtained by a physician (e.g. for patients with a cancer therapy who do not take any \"prescribed medication\" because they receive their treatment in the hospital or dialysis patients). The doctor carries out the risk assessment together with the patient based on the recommendations for individual risk analysis for a severe course of the disease. If there is a serious underlying illness that meets these recommendations, a COVID-19 risk certificate is issued.\r\rEmployers and those affected must jointly consider whether special protective measures are possible in the workplace. If this is not possible, home office can be used. If this is not possible either, workers belonging to the risk group are entitled to paid leave from work.\r",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to information from the minister from 21 April 2020, around 90,000 workers are expected to belong to the risk group. No exact data are available and no information on how many have made use of a paid leave are available as of now.",
            "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The expert group which elaborated the definition of risk groups consisted of representatives of the relevant ministries, of doctors and representatives of the umbrella association of social security institutions.

Thus, a total amount of DKK 730 million (\u20ac98 million) is reserved for new upgrading and training initiatives in order to mitigate the effects of unemployment and company closures due to the coronavirus crisis. Targeted education can ensure better wage income and job opportunities, and education can equip Danes for the new jobs that occurs in the short and long term.

A total amount of DKK 730 million (\u20ac98 million) is reserved for the upgrading and training initiatives. Thus, if a person receives the highest unemployment benefit rate on DKK 19,000 (\u20ac2,550), another DKK 1,900 (\u20ac255) will be added.\r\rUnskilled unemployed thus have the right to start an education such as blacksmith, electrician or other professions where there is a demand for hands. They can continue their education, even if it lasts longer than the unemployment benefit period. With the agreement, insured unemployed people will have the right to start six weeks of job-oriented training from the first day of unemployment and not after five weeks, as is the requirement today. The social partners\u00a0will identify the courses that the unemployed can access immediately.\r\rBesides, the parties to the agreement agree that relevant formal training must be developed in areas where there is an urgent need for labour with special competencies related to the handling of COVID-19.

Numerous choir and dance collectives work continuously to learn and practice the songs and dances performed during the Celebration. Due to the containment measures, the collectives were unable to meet and practice, which in turn affected the income of the leaders of the collectives. To mitigate the financial hardship, the Ministry of Culture developed a temporary support measure for them. Relevant regulation was adopted in May 2020 after the adoption of the supplementary state budget act on 15 April 2020.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The support is meant for leaders of the collectives participating in the Estonian Song and Dance Celebration movement. The target group involves, for example, conductors, folk dance or folk music instructors, concert masters, piano accompanists.\r\rThe support covers 70% of the average income of the period October 2019 \u2013 February 2020 of the collective leader, but not more than \u20ac1,000 per month. The support can be paid for March, April and May 2020.\r\rThe applicant must be a legal person with a valid contract and no tax arrears prior to the emergency situation. They must have received regular support from the budget of the Ministry of Culture in 2019. The income of the collective leader must be decreased between March and May 2020.\rThe total budget of the measure is \u20ac0.6 million and applications were accepted between 12 and 19 May 2020.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the explanatory note of the regulation, around 2,000 collectives have been affected by the COVID-19. \r\rThe support was allocated altogether to 261 collective leaders in the total amount of \u20ac120,768.",

The outstanding income cannot be inferior to the Social Support Index. \rLandlords who have demonstrated reductions in their household income above 20% of the previous month, and whose tenants did not make use of the IHRU loans (see above), can request an interest free loan to compensate the monthly rents that have not been paid, if the available household income diminishes below the Social Support Index for that reason.   \r\r\r",

Enterprises can receive anywhere from \u20ac1.000 up to \u20ac 50.000 for the period of 1 June till 30 September.\r\rSectors which fall under the TOG include the recreation sectors, the hotel, restaurant, caf\u00e9 and bar sectors (HORECA), events, carnivals, theatres and stage performance sectors. SMEs and solo self-employed in these sectors may make use of this measure.\r\rIn total the government aims to support 800,000 entrepreneurs in these sectors (some of which have already been helped by the TOG measure).

Businesses may apply to the local branch of the National Employment Office (which acts as a state authority) for a full grant of 100% of wages for six months for employing a registered job-seeker, which is then reviewed. The candidate for the job can be stated in the application form or it can be selected (recruited) by the Employment Office. If the application is approved, the Office signs a contract with the employer which includes details and conditions about the grant. This is a de minimis subsidy, so the rules of decree 1407/2013/EU apply. (Meaning that certain sectors such as export-linked sectors, farming and fisheries are excluded.)",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Businesses that apply for this subsidy will receive 100% of the wages and social contributions of the employee for six months, but they must promise to keep them on for another three months at least after the grant period at their own expense. The subsidy cannot exceed HUF 200,000 (\u20ac595) per month including social taxes. The employer must choose between two options when applying for the support:\r\r* Headcount increase: the new hire will result in an increase or be level to the existing headcount at the firm (counting part-time workers as one) on the day the application is submitted\r* Net headcount increase: the new hire must be an addition to (or stay level with) the headcount _average in the six months prior to submitting the application_, meaning that any workers laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be re-hired with the help of this subsidy.",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The amount earmarked for this subsidy is HUF 80 billion (\u20ac238 million).The Ministry for Innovation and Technology announced it can help 70,000 people with the measure (calculated by expecting that most companies will apply for the maximum amount of subsidy). In May 2020, when the measure was announced, the number of those registered job-seekers in Hungary, who were in receipt of unemployment benefit or social assistance (income substitution) stood at around 160,000.

The amount of money received from the government depended on the sector with the Government dividing organisations into 'Annex A' and 'Annex B'. Those in Annex A received a larger wage supplement than those in Annex B. \r\rOn 1 June 2020, Government announced that organisations listed in Annex A and Annex B, that have been granted the Wage Supplement will now also be able to apply for a rent refund grant of up to \u20ac2,500 by submitting their lease agreements.\r\rFurther details of this measure remain unclear as full details are yet to be published by the Malta Enterprise.

            "descriptionBackgroundInfo": "Foreclosure proceedings in Croatia are initiated by creditor and securing proceedings are initiated by submitter of motion. In case the law stipulates that an institution or a person, who are not beneficiaries of a certain claim are authorized to initiate foreclosure or securing proceedings for such claim, such institution or a person act as creditors, i.e. submitters of motion in such proceedings. \r\rForeclosure orders are issued exclusively on basis of enforceable or credible documents. Enforceable documents are: enforceable court decision and enforceable judiciary settlement, enforceable settlement from Article 186.a of the Law on Civil Proceedings, enforceable decision of arbitration court, enforceable decision passed in administrative proceedings and enforceable settlement in administrative proceedings, in case they refer to payment of a monetary claim and unless law stipulates otherwise, enforceable notarial decision and enforceable notarial document, settlements entered into in proceedings in front of court of honour at chambers in the Republic of Croatia and settlements entered into in mediation proceedings, in accordance with provisions of the law stipulating mediation proceedings, and other documents stipulated by law as enforceable documents. Pursuant to the Law on Enforcement, credible documents are invoices, bills of exchange, cheque with protest and returned invoices, whenever it is necessary to constitute a claim, public documents, extracts from commercial records, legally notarized private documents that are considered to be public documents in accordance with special regulation. Calculation of accrued interest is considered to constitute invoice.\r\rForeclosure orders in the basis of enforceable documents are passed by courts and on the basis of credible documents by public notaries. Public notary is under obligation to issue and submit foreclosure order or to forward the file to the court within 30 days, at the latest, counting from the date of receipt of motion. Responsible institution for the foreclosure procedure is the Financial Agency (FINA). In case the debtor does not receive foreclosure, one more delivery shall be attempted within time limit that may not be shorter than 30 or longer than 60 days. In case of failed repeated delivery, document that had to be submitted shall be posted on court e-notice board. After that, in case debtor does not file a complaint, foreclosure order becomes valid and enforceable. Upon enforceability of foreclosure order, proceedings are continued in front of agency that implements foreclosure order in accordance with provisions of the Law on Enforcement and the law stipulating foreclosure of monetary assets. Further proceedings depend on whether the debtor has sufficient assets to pay the debt or not. Law on enforcement does not stipulate time limit in which foreclosure order must be issued. In practice, courts issue foreclosure orders within 2-3 months.",
            "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The government issued a decree on amendments to Zakon o provedbi ovrhe na nov\u010danim sredstvima (The Act on the foreclosure on pecuniary assets) (OG 68/18, 2/20 and 46/20) and after the article 25, added two articles 25.a and 25.b) which define special circumstances when foreclosure can be postponed in special circumstances. Due to the Act, the Financial Agency (FINA) will not perform foreclosure procedure on pecuniary assets of natural persons. The Decree is valued for three months with the possibility on extension for next three months. During the mentioned period of postponed foreclosure, no income interest should be calculated and paid.  ",
            "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As many natural persons in Croatia face serious problems with foreclosure, such measure should be very welcomed in the circumstances of COVID19 and present financial difficulties. This is particularly important knowing that the Act allows for HRK 100 (\u20ac 13) of initial debt to become HRK 1,000 (\u20ac130), with almost no limit. ",
