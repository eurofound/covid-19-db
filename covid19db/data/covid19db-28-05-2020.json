The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ",

The goal is to encourage companies to employ this job scheme to assure, when possible, business continuity. \rIn particular, Article 1, lett. n) of the Decree authorises the adoption of the smart working regime without executing, with the employees, the individual agreement required by the law in normal conditions. This individual agreement contains, in general, significant dispositions steering the performance under the smart working regime, like the rules implementing the right to disconnect. Moreover, Article 1, lett. n) specifies that the informative obligations bearing on the employer according to Law No. 81 of 2017 can be fulfilled, while the measure is into force, through electronic communications. \r\rThe measure concerns all the employers, regardless their dimension or sector, and is meant to remain in power until 31 July 2020 (day in which the six-month state of emergency declared by the Government on 31 January 2020 will expire). \r\rFurthermore, this measure affects only employees, since smart working is not applicable to other categories of workers (for instance freelancers, self-employed etc.).\rSocial partners, finally, have not been involved in the preparatory works of this measure.",

These amendments shorten the notice period for temporary lay-offs. \r\rIn Finland, employers are responsible for informing about temporary lay-offs. In normal circumstances, the notice period for temporary lay-offs is 14 days. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Act was amended in March 2020 and therefore the notice period will be 5 days  between April and June 2020. \r\rMany collective agreements further regulate the notice period for temporary lay-offs and these regulations laid down in collective agreements shall apply. At the time of writing, around 90% of collective agreements have been adapted to reflect the temporary provisions. ",

The measures can be divided into two main groups. The first set of measures are measures that are horizontal in nature and are aimed at maintaining the stability of the economy through the provision of stand-style arrangements and new liquidity. The second set of measures refers to sectoral measures that are both vertically and horizontally targeted with the aim of encouraging everyone to actively undertake activities aimed at preserving jobs, i.e. safeguarding employment. In this regard, 16 laws have been amended. Additional amendments to the General tax law have been adopted  on 7 April (OG 42/2020) ( see case number 288) and the new Ordinance on Amendments to the Ordinance on Implementation of the General Tax Law published on 8 April. (OG 43/2020).",

Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month. \r\rHowever, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.  ",
