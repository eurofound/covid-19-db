This was complementary to other measures (see case AT-2020-12-/229), as those two target groups would not be able to profit from the short-time working schemes.","The support is a one-off payment and does not have to be paid back. In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:Phase 1: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is €500 if the net income p.a. was below €6,000 and €1,000 if it was above €6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is €33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accomodation rents) and freelance workers.Phase 2: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at €2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.All applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to €6,000. In general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 December 2020. ","Info from 1 April: Around 100,000 applications for phase 1 were counted so far. The total funds for the hardship fund were increased from €1 to 2 billion.Info from 20 April: The first phase has been completed with 144,000 applications made. A total of EUR 121 mio. was paid out in the first phase.

The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ","The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees’ (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to 2,820 Euros (£2,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.Employers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.",The scheme has been critizised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures).

Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month. However, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.  ","The support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by coronavirus is implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by awarding grants as a form of co-financing of wage costs. The Croatian Employment Service (CES) awards grants to an eligible employer in the amount of HRK 3.250,00 (€434) per month for full-time worker and HRK 1.625,00 (€217) per month for part-time worker. CES also awards a proportional part of the amount of HRK 3,250.00 or HRK 1,625.00 per worker for the time they did not work according to the decision of the Civil Protection Directorate. The support can be provided to a) employers in the following activities: providing accommodation and preparation and serving of food and drinks (Sector I), transportation and storage (Sector H) and health tourism; labour-intensive activities within the manufacturing industry like textiles, clothing, footwear, leather, wood and furniture; b) employers who have been banned from performing their business activities by decisions of the Civil Protection Headquarters (national, county, local self-government units) and cannot carry out their activities, and c) all other employers who can prove the adverse impact of special circumstances, if their income is reduced by more than 20%. Since 26 March 2020 all beneficiaries of grants for self-employment (owners and employees), employers who have been registered at the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute by 29 February 2020 and all workers employed until 29 February 2020 have also been included. The support cannot be granted if there has been a decrease in the number of employees in the period from 20 March 2020 until the date of submission of the Grant Application, if the percentage of dismissal is greater than: 40 % for employers employing up to 10 workers; 20 % for small businesses; 15 % for medium-sized enterprises and 10 % for large companies. The aforementioned amount of the grant - HRK 3,250 or HRK 1,625 per worker - is applied for March 2020, while for April and May 2020 it will be increased per worker monthly to HRK 4,000 (€ 534) for full-time job or HRK 2,625 (€ 267) for part-time job. The state will also cover also payment of social contributions, which amounts to HRK 1,460 (€ 194) for a net wage of HRK 4,000. In total, the state will pay HRK 5,460 (€ 728) per employee.  ","At the end of March,  around 65,000 employers with around 400,000 thousand workers were registered as users of the scheme at the CES.  At the end of April, the government has paid more than one and a half billion HRK (EURO 200 million) to preserve jobs for around 485,000 employees. Almost 84,000 employers have received support, including 145 large entrepreneurs.The main criterion for assistance was a 20 percent drop in turnover. Leading recipients of the grants are big touristic company Valamar Riviera with more than 2,500 employees who have been paid more than eight million HRK (EURO 1.07 million) followed by Boxmark Leather with more than 2,000 employees, Mlinar with 1,737 employees, a car parts manufacturer from Solin AD Plastik with more than 1,500 employees. Of all beneficiaries of the grant 91,78% are micro firms with less than 10 employees, 6,99% are SME with less than 50 employees, 1.06% are medium employers with less than 250 employees, 0.03% are bigger employers with more than 250 employees.

However, in Croatia it is difficult to evaluate if subsidies and transfers have achieved these objectives. State subsidies in Croatia are relatively high. They have been concentrated in a few sectors, with a high proportion of them going to the national railway company Hrvatske željeznice ((HŽ) and to the agriculture sector. Due to the EU requirement and membership, Croatia has improved policies related to state subsidies and lowered their level. ","Amendments to the Act on Personal Income Tax and Amendments to the Act on the Company Income Tax (OG 32/20) introduced novelties regarding the impact of grants on the income tax base and tax liability for entrepreneurs which received grants intended to mitigate the adverse effects of special circumstances. Income tax payers record grants into realized income, but exclude it from the tax base when determining the income tax liability. According to the amended Act on Company Income Tax, grants obtained due to special circumstances do not affect the threshold for compulsory shift from personal income tax to company income tax. This threshold is HRK 7.5 million (€ 1 million) of revenue. Furthermore, grants obtained do not affects the threshold of realized annual revenues according to which the tax rate of 12% and 18% is determined (the threshold is HRK 7.5 million (€ 1 million) of revenue. It is hard to predict the role of this measure and the number of possible users but from the public discussions it can be assessed that it would be relatively limited.

These measures mainly concern: flexibilization of the working time, working from home, teleworking.Soon after this, on the 16 March 2020, the Romanian President has declared a state of emergency – as a result, schools  remained closed until Orthodox Easter (19 April) initially. After 30 days, the state of emergency was prolonged with another 30 days, till 15 May 2020 - during all this period, the schools remain suspended. This situation left a lot of employees without any immediate solutions to ensure their children supervision and care. To  respond to this problem, the Romanian Parliament passed a law (Law no. 19/2020) requiring employers (both in the public and the private sector) to grant paid leave to one of the parents if schools are closed due to “extreme situations”. ","According to the law 19/2020 , employers must grant employees paid leave if schools are closed in exceptional circumstances, but only if the tasks associated with the employees’ roles cannot be performed in “working from home” or teleworking conditions. Paid leave can be granted to only one of the parents, and only if the child in care is of maximum 12 years of age (or 18 years of age for children with a disability), who are formally registered as attending courses in a school. In some sectors, the parent's request for leave is conditioned by the employer's acceptance (national energy system units, operating units in the nuclear sectors, continuous fire units, health and social care units, telecommunications, public radio and television, rail transport, units that ensure the public transport and sanitation of the localities, as well as the supply of the population with gas, electricity, heat, and water). During such leave, employees will be entitled to a payment of up to 75% of the employee’s base salary, but not more than 75% of the average gross salary in the economy. The allowance is subject to personal income tax and social security contributions (i.e. personal income tax, social security contribution, health insurance contribution and work insurance contribution). The net value of the allowance paid by the employer (the amount actually received by the parent) can be recovered from the Guarantee Fund for the payment of salary claims; the corresponding personal income tax and the social security contributions are borne by the employer. To recover the net allowance, employers should submit a request to the local or the Bucharest unemployment agency. ",These applies to all employees with children in care.

In response to the Covid-19 crisis, the government adopted a ‘temporary lay-off scheme’ and reimbursement of wage compensations to workers who cannot work due to force majeure. The measure addresses laid-off workers for whom company temporary fails to provide work and workers who cannot work due to force majeure: workers in quarantine, who cannot work from home; workers who look after children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; workers who cannot come to work on the grounds of the suspension of public transport or ban on the border crossing.","According to the Employment Relationship Act, when a company temporarily fails to provide work for business reasons (in the event of a temporary lay-off), the worker is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of 80% of the wage basis. The wage basis is determined at the worker’s average monthly wage for full-time work during the past three months. On the other hand, if a worker cannot carry out his work due to force majeure, he is entitled to half of the payment he would have received if he was working, but not less than 70% of the minimum wage. The temporary laid-off worker is obliged to respond to the employer’s invitation in a manner and under the conditions laid down in the lay-off letter (Employment Relationship Act, Articles 137, 138). The measure being examined, attempting to cushions the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, grants the employers with 80% reimbursement of the sums payed to provide the economic treatment mentioned above to workers (in case of temporary lay-off as well as force majeure). The state reimbursement is funded with the state budget. Reimbursement is limited to the average monthly salary in 2019 and cannot be lower than the minimum wage (it is thus higher than statutory determined compensations). The maximum length of receiving compensation is from 13 March to 31 May.","Only companies with a 20% lower income in the first half of 2020 and 50% lower income in the second half of 2020 than in the same periods of 2019 are entitled to reimbursements. If their income is higher, companies will have to pay them back. Not included are organizations with more than 70% of their revenue from the public budget as well as financial and insurance sector. Employment Service will administer requests for compensations from employers.First reactions show that the rule requesting 20% lower incomes in the first half of 2020 excludes many companies from the support mechanism (Mekina, 2020). Companies which had a high growth of activities up to mid-March will comply with the rule only if their revenue decreases enormously in the following months.",National government; Social insurance,All companies,National funds,"Trade unions and employers' organizations have submitted many proposals to the measure, mainly for clarifying the definitions. More importantly, employers' organizations proposed the withdrawal of limitations linked to company revenues. They argued that state support shouldn’t stimulate companies to work less. Trade unions demanded a fixed period of six months after the epidemic in which employers shouldn’t lay off workers for business reasons. Some proposals were accepted but not these two. The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council.

Deferred payment must be paid in two years, until 31 March 2022, in one installment with no interest charge. It is an automatically recognized right meaning that there is no need to submit any claim for obtaining this right. Eligible are self-employed persons (including farmers) who do not employ other workers.The second law (ZIUZEOP, adopted on 2 April 2020) introduces the right of self-employed persons to be fully exempt from paying social security contributions. Among eligible persons there are self-employed, associates, and farmers who have no insurance deriving from other types of employment. They have to make a request to Financial Administration in which they prove 25% lower income in March than in February and 50% lower income in April and May than in February. Later on, beneficiaries will have to pay social security contributions if in the first half of 2020 their revenue exceeds 80% of the revenue in the same period of 2019 and if in the second half of 2020 it exceeds 120% of the revenue in the same period of 2019. Postponed and annulled payments of social security contributions are limited to the period between 13 March and 31 May 2020. After 31 May no new claims will be possible. In addition to these two measures, self-employed may also claim for deferred payment of income tax.","While the law (ZIUZEOP) was in parliamentary procedure, non-governmental organizations submitted a proposal that the referential period should not be one month (February), but a more extended period (six months, one year or more years). The argument was that this rule is going to exclude many self-employed persons, as they typically receive their fees irregularly and many may have had no money inflows in February. None of their proposals was integrated into the final law.Two cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stress that the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed is not eligible.",National government; Social insurance,Self-employed ,National funds,"Trade unions and employers' organizations were consulted about the overall scheme of the law, but no one of them submitted proposals linked to this measure. The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council.

The measure is limited to the period between 13 March and 31 May 2020. After 31 May no new claims will be possible.","While the law (ZIUZEOP) was in under discussion in the Parliament, non-governmental organizations proposed that the referential period should not be one month (February), but a more extended period (six months, one year or more years). The argument was that this rule is going to exclude many self-employed persons, as they typically receive their fees irregularly and many may have no money inflows in February. None of their proposals was integrated into the final law.Two cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for monthly basic income. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government has suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). These associations stress that not eligible is the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed.",National government,Self-employed ,National funds,"Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted proposals to the law.

Foreign workers or seasonal workers employed in Austria are no longer allowed to enter the country, resulting in a shortage of labour both on farms and in food processing companies (e.g. meat sector). In order to ensure and maintain the food supply, all the work that is now necessary must be carried out on time. The Chambers of Agriculture, together with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and the machinery ring, are endeavouring to support farmers and processing enterprises in carrying out the necessary work on schedule despite the current situation and thus to continue to ensure the supply of domestic food.

In the context of the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the system was relaxed.The partial activity is intended for all employees who suffer a reduction in remuneration attributable to :- either a reduction in the working hours practiced in the establishment or part of the establishment below the legal working hours (35 hours);- a temporary closure of all or part of the establishment.Requests for partial activity are made by employers if the drop in activity is caused by one of the reasons referred to in Article R. 5122-1 of the Labour Code, including circumstances of an exceptional nature, which apply in the present crisis.During the period of partial activity :- The employer receives from the public authorities (Services and Payment Agency - ASP) an allowance equivalent to a share of the hourly pay of the employee placed in partial activity;- The employee receives a partial activity allowance from the employer in lieu of salary for the period during which the employee is placed in partial activity.","The short-time working scheme cover all employees of the private sector. With the new provisions adopted to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the partial activity allowance paid by the State to the company - co-financed by the State and by the joint body that manages the unemployment insurance scheme (Unédic) - is no longer a lump sum, but is proportional to the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity. The 'remainder payable' by the employer, i.e. the amount of the remuneration which the employer must pay to the employee, is zero for all employees whose remuneration is less than 4.5 gross SMIC (€45.68 per hour or €6,927.39 per month).The compensation due to the employee covers at least 70% of his previous gross remuneration, i.e. approximately 84% of the net salary.There is nothing to prevent an employer from compensating its employees in excess of 70% of gross salary if it can/wishes to do so or if a collective or company-level agreement so provides.In all cases, a minimum of €8.03 per hour is respected.Specific measures are planned for employees of private employers (cleaning ladies) and childcare assistants (who look after young children) who are usually paid by the hour with a job voucher system.","As of April 7, 2020, 692,000 applications for partial activity have been filed. They concern 669,000 establishments and 6,300,000 employees (2.3 million more than on 31 March).  About 59% of employees who have applied for partial activity since 1 March work in establishments with fewer than 50 employees. These establishments account for 34% of private salaried employment. Conversely, those working in establishments with more than 250 employees account for 15% of employees in partial activity, while these establishments account for 20% of private salaried employment.The Ministry of Labour (DARES and DGEFP) and the public employment service Pôle Emploi have decided to update these data every weeks.

Depending on the development of the situation and as required, those who finish their civil service in April or May 2020 may also receive an extension of up to 3 months. It is planned to transfer civilian servicemen who are currently serving or will soon be serving to positions where there is special need (e.g. if a civilian servant would have an assignment for a kindergarten, but this is closed, he will be assigned to another facility instead, e.g. a retirement home). In addition, former civil servants are recruited voluntarily for full-time positions (at least 40 hours per week, overtime can be added) from May or June 2020 for a duration of two to three months.While regular civil servants who have been mandatorily extended receive their regular remuneration (€346.70) plus supplement of  €189.90 (tax free), the newly recruited voluntary former civil servants receive in addition to this a flat-rate compensation of almost €1,300 (gross).

Teleworking is a right provided for in Article L. 1222-9 of the Labour Code, resulting from the Order of 22 September 2017, and must be favoured in phase 3 of the epidemic. An employee can therefore ask his employer to benefit from telework until further notice. The employer may refuse, but reasons must be given for the refusal.","Since the passage to stage 3 of the epidemic, the implementation of telework must be imperative as soon as the workstation allows it. Telework can be implemented when the workstation layout is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity and to guarantee the protection of employees.Article L. 1222-11 of the Labour Code mentions the risk of an epidemic as a possible justification for the use of telework without the employee's agreement. The implementation of telework in this context does not require any particular formalism.In a circular, the ministry of Labour estimate the employee must receive an allowance intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework: 'In the context of the current health crisis – since telework is carried out, in the majority of cases, over the entire actual working time and is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity, to guarantee the protection of employees and for reasons of public health – it should be considered that the employer is obliged to pay his employee a telework allowance, intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework'. Indeed, the employer has an obligation to bear the professional expenses. This obligation is provided for without restriction by the case-law, which is of general application and must cover teleworkers.'However, adds the ministry of Labour, in view of the difficulty of identifying and circumscribing the expenses relating to the professional activity and those relating to personal life, it is in the employer's interest to favour a lump sum which will simplify its management'.If the allowance paid by the employer is a lump sum, it will then be deemed to be used in accordance with its purpose and will be exempt from social security contributions up to an overall limit of €10/month for an employee who teleworks one day per week. This exempt lump-sum allowance increases to €20/month for an employee teleworking two days a week, €30/month for 3 days a week, etc.","In 2017, about 3.0% of employees were teleworking at least once a week.

The management can abstain from the duty to start the compulsory settlement or bankruptcy if the company became insolvent because of the epidemic. Other changes tackle compensation of unpaid wages from the Guarantee Fund, personal bankruptcy procedures, and enforcement proceedings.","Deferred compulsory settlement or bankruptcy means that management is not obliged to start this procedure during the period of epidemic and the three succeeding months. The management can abstain from the duty if the company becomes insolvent due to the state, ministry or local authority’s ban on production or trade. On the other hand, the law reinforces some workers’ rights. When a company gets workers' wages reimbursed it must transfer them to employees within one month at the latest.

It is thus covered by a limited set of labour rights, like the ban on discrimination and harassment, the interdiction of child work, rules on working time, breaks, and rest periods, the prohibition of work for some specific groups. The Agricultural Act explicitly mentions viticulture, fruit growing, hop growing, and vegetable growing as sectors much in need of such unprotected and occasional labour force.The 2020 provisions lifting restrictions to the utilization of temporary work in agriculture have been introduced to put a remedy to the shortage of immigrant workers in the agricultural sector, due to the limitations to cross-border movements caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. ","The measure responds to the concern of some agricultural sectors which, after the ban on border crossing relating to the COVID-19 epidemic, remained without seasonal migrant workers. By rule, ‘temporary work in agriculture’ is limited to 120 days a year. The emergency regulation annuls this limitation until the end of 2020. It means that such type of work can be carried out without restriction all year. The emergency regulation also stipulates that Public Employment Service may assign temporary work in agriculture to temporary laid-off persons. Upon the request of agricultural enterprise, the Public Employment Service sends to work a person who is temporary laid-off due to the epidemic",Hop growers report on troubles due to labour shortage after the ban on the border crossing.

Farmers have also the right to ask for financial compensation for the loss of income during the epidemic, while fishermen may claim for 40% subsidy for berths in the port. Another measure obliges public institutions to buy local food.","Farmers and fishermen who became sick with COVID-19 may apply for financial support if they are enrolled in the register of agricultural businesses. Financial support should be equal to real damage, but cannot exceed 80% of the minimum wage.Emergency regulation endows agricultural businesses with the right to financial compensation for the loss of income during the epidemic. The loss of income means the inability of selling supply or lower scale of production if it causes a decrease in revenue by 20%. Agricultural businesses may claim for financial support for the time of epidemic as well as for three succeeding months. The calculation of compensation will be based on a flat rate taking into consideration the number of hectares or livestock units or average catch in the last three years. This support is not compatible with another support under emergency regulation, the monthly basic income (see ‘Monthly basic income’), as one rules out the other.The law obliges public institutions to buy at least 50% of agricultural products from local growers if the purchase value does not exceed a determined sum when the public procurement has to appear in the Official Journal of the European Union.

In addition, the employer may impose the taking of rest days placed in a time-saving account.The Ordinance provides for two limits: 1. The employer must give the employee one day's notice. 2. Derogations may concern a maximum of 10 rest days by 31 December 2020.The employer, additionally, may set the dates of leave without taking into account the simultaneous leave entitlements of spouses employed in the same company. The employer may dissociate their leaves if the presence of only one of the two spouses is indispensable to the company, or if one of them has already exhausted his or her paid leave (normally the Labour Code provides that spouses or partners who are employees of the same company are entitled to simultaneous leave).Finally, the ordinance allows the employer (without collective agreement) to derogate to the Sunday rest. He is allowed to ask employees to work on Sunday. These derogations do not apply to all undertakings, however. They concern firms in sectors deemed essential to the continuity of economic life and national security (the list of which will be laid down by decree) and firms which provide the above mentioned with services necessary for the performance of their main activity.

This premium is not subject to income tax. This scheme has been renewed in 2020, but is reserved for employers who have set up a profit-sharing scheme in the company's results (""intéressement""). However, this scheme has been modified to take into account the COVID-19 crisis to support purchase power of employees working during the crisis in essential services and all other companies that have stayed open.","According to an ordinance dated 1 April 2020 published in the context of the health crisis, the exceptional purchasing power bonus, that is exempted of social contribution and tax-free, can reach €2,000 for companies that have set up a profit-sharing agreement. Those that do not have one can nevertheless pay the exceptional bonus, but within the limit of €1,000. On the basis of the Article 11 of the emergency law of 23 March 2020 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, an ordinance published on 2 April 2020 relaxes the conditions for payment of the exceptional purchasing power bonus provided for in Article 7 of the law on the financing of social security for 2020 (LFSS 2020). The aim is to encourage companies to make use of this scheme in the context of the epidemic, bearing in mind that the premium can now be paid until 31 August 2020 (instead of 30 June).Companies that do not have a profit-sharing agreement ('accord d'intéressement') can use the bonus by benefiting from these exemptions, if the amount paid does not exceed €1,000. Until now, these companies have been excluded from the measure.For companies which implement a profit-sharing agreement on the date of payment of the bonus, the maximum amount exempted is €2,000 (instead of €1,000 up to now). The profit-sharing agreement may be for a period of between one and three years if it was concluded between 1 January and 31 August 2020, with the deadline of 30 June 2020 being extended. Initially, the exceptional purchase power bonus scheme allowed its amount to be modulated between employees according to remuneration, classification level, length of actual presence during the year or the working time provided for in the employment contract. The ordinance provides for a new possibility of modulation, depending on 'working conditions related to the Covid-19 epidemic'. According to the Ministry of Labour, this new possibility was intended in particular to give companies the possibility of rewarding more people who, for example, are forced to go to their workplace than those who are not obliged to do so","So far, only 37,000 companies have paid a bonus in 2020. The Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire call to reward employees 'who had the courage to go to their workplace' despite the health crisis.Particularly targeted, large retailers seems to have received the message: Auchan, Carrefour, Intermarché, Lidl, Système U and Leclerc have already announced that their employees would receive a bonus of €1,000. The same goes for the 15,000 Veolia employees who remained in the field to manage water and waste, or for 5,000 employees of the Total group.It should be noted that some companies have not yet made their decision, waiting in particular to assess the effects of the crisis on their cash flow: they now have until August 31 to do so (compared to June 30 initially).",Trade unions; Company / Companies,All companies; Companies providing essential services,No special funding required,"To provide a bonus over €1,000 exempted of social contribution and taxes, the employer have to reach an agreement with the representative trade unions, or if there are no trade union, with the works council, or if there is no works council, after a vote of the employee.",Direct consultation,Negotiated,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041746313; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041776879

Over 60% of holders of family agricultural holdings are over 55 and less than 4 % under 35.

This poses a serious threat to the further development and even survival of the rural areas themselves. Young people are a key resource for the development of a modern and competitive agricultural sector, primarily because of their willingness and ability to adapt easily to technological changes, new practices and changing market conditions which is a requirement to increase productivity and competitiveness. Some achieved progress has come under the question due to the recent crisis.","The target groups of financial instruments Micro loans for rural development are primarily small business entities in the agricultural, processing and forestry sectors.

The measure offers the possibility of settling bills created up to three months before the loan application is received, with significantly less documentation and a prepared Business Plan form. The Business Plan form is quite simple with pages on two-page questions, which significantly shortens the time of preparation of the application and enables easier and faster processing. Due to restricted movement of possible beneficiaries and with the desire to simplify the procedure, the Croatian Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments (HAMAG-BICRO) recommends on-line applications.

More specifically, this measure makes more flexible the access to benefits in case of cessation of activity for self-employed workers in case of financial difficulty. The measure is part of the Royal Decree 8/2020.The cessation of activity benefit already existed. What changes under the new regulation is that the requirements are relaxed and times change: it will be charged for a period of one month (or until the state of alarm ends).

GB-2020-13/521,Coronavirus business interruption loan scheme for SMEs,Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme,United Kingdom,Applies nationwide,03/23/2020,03/23/2026,Temporary,Legislation or other statutory regulation,Entirely new measure ,Supporting businesses to stay afloat,Access to finance,04/12/2020,"As part of the Budget 2020 package, the Government announced that it would provide a new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) to both SMEs and large companies (see separate case). Loans were initially due to be worth up to GBP1.2m to support SMEs. On 17 March, this was increased to GPB5 million. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan. The Government has also said the first 12 months of the loan would be offered interest free, with Government meeting the cost of those interest payments. Initially, the interest free period was due to last 6 months.  The scheme went live on 23 March 2020.The background regulation is the Coronavirus Act 2020, emergency legislation which received Royal Assent on the 25 March after having been fast-tracked through Parliament in just four days.","This temporary scheme aims to allow small and medium businesses across the UK with an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million, which are experiencing lost or deferred revenues to access loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance of up to £5 million for up to 6 years.The government will also make a Business Interruption Payment to cover the first 12 months of interest payments and any lender-levied fees. This means smaller businesses will benefit from no upfront costs and lower initial repayments.The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to pre-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs.The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank. There are 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks, as well as challenger banks, asset-based lenders and smaller specialist local lenders.  A business is eligible if:•it is based in the UK•has an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million•has a borrowing proposal which the lender would consider viable, if not for the coronavirus pandemic. To access the scheme, businesses should approach their own provider – ideally via the lender’s website. They may also consider approaching other lenders if they are unable to access the finance they need.  Decision-making on eligibility for CBILS is fully delegated to the accredited CBILS lenders. On 25 March, the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority together wrote to Britain’s banking sector with a warning not to allow fundamentally viable companies to collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.Finance terms are up to six years for term loans and asset finance facilities. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years. The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt.At the discretion of the lender, the scheme may be used for unsecured lending for facilities of GBP 250,000 and under. Initially, the eligibility criteria stated that for facilities above GBP 250,000, the lender must establish a lack or absence of security prior to businesses using CBILS. It also stated that if the lender could offer finance on normal commercial terms without the need to make use of the scheme, they should do so. However, these were changed as the scheme progressed. Thus, on the 2 April 2020, the Government made changes to the scheme, namely:• No personal guarantees for facilities under GBP 250k: Personal guarantees of any form cannot be taken under the scheme for any facilities below GBP 250k.• Personal guarantees for facilities above GBP 250k: Personal guarantees may still be required, at a lender’s discretion, but recoveries under these are capped at a maximum of 20% of the outstanding balance of the CBILS facility after the proceeds of business assets have been applied. A Principal Private Residence (PPR) cannot be taken as security to support a personal guarantee or as security for a CBIL backed facility.• Security: For all facilities, including those over GBP 250,000, CBILS can now support lending to smaller businesses even where a lender considers there to be sufficient security, making more smaller businesses eligible to receive the business interruption payment.The Government announced that these changes should be retrospectively applied by lenders for any CBILS facilities offered since 23 March 2020. For any commercial (non-CBILS) facilities offered since the same date, providing the borrower meets the CBILS eligibility criteria, lenders have been asked to bring these facilities onto CBILS wherever possible (e.g. where the lender is accredited to offer the same facility through CBILS) and changes retrospectively applied as necessary.","Unknown; this is a new measure.The measure will support up to £1 billion of funding lending to SMEs,",National government,SMEs,National funds,"Assume that there was discussion/consultation with the small business associations, There was discussion with the banking and finance industry.",Unknown,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme; https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents

The Coronavirus Act 2020 is the major piece of legislation covering the government response.","As part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). This recognises that prior to the crisis, companies often sell short-term debt ('commercial paper') to the market as a quick and effective way of raising working capital/ Thus, under CCFF, the Bank of England will instead buy this short-term debt.The scheme then aims to ""…help businesses across a range of sectors to pay wages and suppliers, even while experiencing severe disruption to cashflows.  The facility will offer financing on terms comparable to those prevailing in markets in the period before the Covid-19 economic shock, and will be open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the shock. The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms’ balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms’ credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock.""So the scheme will support companies which are fundamentally strong, but have been affected by a short-term funding squeeze, enabling them to continue financing their short-term liabilities. It is also designed to support corporate finance markets overall and ease the supply of credit to all firms.The scheme is open to larger firms whether or not they have previously sought credit in this way.

GB-2020-12/524,Reclaiming of statutory sick pay by SMEs,Reclaiming of Statutory Sick Pay by SMEs,United Kingdom,Applies nationwide,03/17/2020,,Open ended,Legislation or other statutory regulation,New aspects included into existing measure,Income protection beyond short-time work,Paid sick leave,04/13/2020,"As it is anticipated that many employees will be off sick with the virus (the Government states that in a worst case scenario, a fifth of all employees will be absent from work) and that a large proportion of these who work in SMEs will only have statutory entitlement, this measure allows eligible firms to claim back the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) they disburse to such employees.The legal reference is the emergency legislation, the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 39 is the relevant regulation (which amends The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992); this section gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.","In Budget 2020, the UK Government announced that Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be met in full for up to 14 days per employee. The Chancellor estimates that this will cost up to £2 billion and help up to 2 million businesses. In its factsheet on government support for those affected by Covid-19, HM Treasury said that the eligibility criteria for the scheme would be as follows:• this refund will cover up to 2 weeks’ SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19;• employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible; the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020;• employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19;• employers should maintain records of staff absences, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note;• eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of Statutory Sick Pay to self-isolators comes into force;• the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible. Existing systems are not designed to facilitate employer refunds for SSP47.SSP is the minimum that employers have to pay out to qualifying sick employees. It is currently paid at GBP 94.25 per week (GBP 95.85 from 6 April 2020) and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. In order to qualify for SSP, an employee’s average weekly earnings must be above GBP 118 (GBP 120 from 6 April 2020). Some employers may pay enhanced sick pay over and above the SSP rate. This would be detailed in an employment contract. The self-employed are not eligible for SSP. The Statutory Sick Pay (General) (Coronavirus Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/287) came into force on 13 March 2020. These Regulations (as amended) make it clear in law that employees are entitled to SSP if they are unable to work because they are self-isolating as a result of them or someone in their household showing symptoms of coronavirus.  Normally, SSP is paid from the fourth day of absence. However, on the 28 March, the Government made the Statutory Sick Pay (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Waiting Days and General Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/374). These provide that SSP is payable from the first day of absence where a worker is self-isolating because they or someone in their household has shown symptoms of coronavirus. The Regulations have retrospective from 13 March 2020.Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.The guidance says that employers will be covered in the following circumstances: If employers are: • claiming for an employee who’s eligible for sick pay due to coronavirus• had a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started on or before 28 February 2020• had fewer than 250 employees on 28 February 2020.The scheme covers all types of employment contracts, including:• full-time employees• part-time employees• employees on agency contracts• employees on flexible or zero-hour contracts","Uptake currently unknown as there is no data available at this stage. It will apply to those employees working in organisations employing 250 or under, who are away from work due to coronavirus. This also applies if such employees are self-isolating due to a member of their household being unwell with the virus.

Futhermore, the Minister of Labour announced the postponement of the entry into force of the second part of the unemployment insurance reform, initially scheduled for 1 April 2020. The new rules, which modified the calculations of the duration of compensation and the reference daily wage used to determine the amount of the back-to-work allowance, are therefore postponed to an entry into force on 1 September 2020. These rules are less favourable to jobseekers.","This measure apply to:- all jobseekers receiving unemployment benefit who reach the end of their entitlement during the month of March, whether they are seasonal, temporary workers or intermittent performers;- jobseekers who may have worked again during the period they are entitled to employment benefit, and who may therefore extend the duration of their entitlement to unemployment benefit;- beneficiaries of the Specific Solidarity Allowance (ASS) whose renewal takes place in March; the renewal of rights will be studied at the end of the confinement period.Payment of unemployment benefit will be extended until the end of the confinement period. This additional compensation will not reduce any future entitlements.The extension is automatic on the part of public employment service (Pôle Emploi) and is effective for payments since the beginning of April. Jobseekers are still required to keep up to date. On the other hand, job search monitoring is suspended during the entire period of confinement. No jobseeker will be struck off the list or sanctioned during this period, ensures a question and answer published on the Pôle emploi website.A decree published on 14 April provides that the payment of benefits to the unemployed at the end of their rights will go at least 'until the end of the calendar month in which the end of the confinement occurs', details the Ministry of Labour. At this stage, it would therefore be until 31 May 2020. But 'this date will be extended in case of a new extension of the containment measure', the ministry specifies.","According to the daily Les Echos, between 60,000 and 90,000 jobseekers should arrive at the end of the allowance period in March. It can be estimated a similar number of April. The measure could support from 150,000 to 250,000 jobseekers if the confinement period ends, as expected, on 11 May 2020.",Public employment service,Unemployed,National funds,The measure is decided by government but with connexion with social partners managing the unemployment scheme.,Not applicable,No involvement,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000041755953&fastPos=20&fastReqId=611522783&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041798325

The landlord may not claim the arrears of payment in court until the end of 31 December 2020 or cover them from a deposit handed over by the tenant.In addition, the landlord may not legally demand payment of rent due between 1 April and 30 June 2020 until the end of 31 December 2020, nor may he/she cover it from a security deposit provided by the tenant.

Many people are even more concerned with how they should pay their next electricity bill.Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Green Party) and Wolfgang Urbantschitsch (Board Member of E-Control) explained why these concerns are unfounded. Even if there are payment difficulties, there will be no shutdowns on the part of the energy suppliers.","Until further notice, in any case until May 1st, ""no one in Austria will turn off electricity, gas or heat, "" the minister and the E-Control board assured.

However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.This measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  ","In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists.

If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (€100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. The amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than 150,00 kn, nor more than 1.500,00 kn.

This quick initiation was possible because the country had already prepared to start electronic prescriptions in a pilot project in two political districts in the regional province in Carinthia in April 2020. However, according to the Austrian Chamber of Doctors, this measure will be discontinued again after the crisis is over. The measure is targeted especially to those who need long-term medication.In addition to the electronic prescription, further measures for the period of the CoV pandemic were introduced, including for instance the suspension of the authorization requirement (chief physician requirement) for many medications. Furthermore, ambulance transports are free of charge until further notice; the same applies to medical aids and aids up to a total of €1,500 as well as X-ray and cross-sectional examinations. Sickness reports to doctors are currently also possible by telephone. Doctors, psychotherapists and midwives can also invoice necessary telemedical treatments (via Skype, video conference or telephone) such as a service performed in the ordination.","The procedure of getting an electronic recipe is that the patient calls the doctor's office.

There, the patients can either pick up the medicine themselves or send someone.In cases where e-medication is not working or is not yet working, doctors were also given the opportunity to send prescriptions to the pharmacies by fax or email. The electronic prescription is primarily intended to help older people and people with previous illnesses to avoid medical practices as best they can given the spread of coronavirus in Austria.

The criminal prosecution of the perpetrators would be further ensured, entry and proximity bans would be further pronounced, and directions would be implemented. This would mean that the police can give those affected by domestic violence applications for an injunction against violent partners at first contact and take the completed forms with them on inspection visits a few days later.

Due to travel bans, maintaining this care has become a major problem. But also those who are cared for by family members may encounter capacity problems, as well as those in older people's homes or care homes, when staff get sick or are in quarantine.Thus, the government has announced to provide a specific Covid-Fund worth €100 million for the 460,000 persons in need of care, to be distributed among Austria's nine federal states (as nursing care lies within their competencies).

This was on top of a series of measures announced at Budget 2020 on the 12 March, where the government announced GBP 30 billion of additional support for public services, individuals and businesses experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.  Changes to SSP were part of the initial Budget package, subsequently extended on the 17 March, and accounted for in Sections 39 to 44 of the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 40 amends the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.  Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the changes in SSP will be back-dated to 13th of March.","In order to traditionally qualify for SSP (currently £94.25 and payable by employers for a maximum of 28 weeks), there is a wait of three days before an individual employee becomes eligible. However, under the new ruling, SSP will be paid from day 1, rather than day 4 of an individual's absence from work if that person is absent from work due to sickness or the need to self-isolate caused by COVID-19. This applied retrospectively from the 13th of March. Moreover, from the 20th of March onwards, those who have COVID-19 or who are advised to self-isolate will be able to obtain an “isolation note” by visiting the National Health Service (NHS) 111 online and completing an online form, rather than visiting a doctor. For COVID-19 cases, this replaces the usual need to provide a “fit note” after seven days of sickness absence. For those not eligible for SSP e.g. the self-employed or those earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of GBP 118 per week, but who have COVID-19 or are advised to self-isolate, the government says that they can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit (UC) or new style Employment and Support Allowance. For those who are self-employed and receiving Universal Credit with COVID-19 or advised to self-isolate, the requirements of the Minimum Income Floor will be temporarily relaxed. This change took effect on 13 March and will last for the duration of the outbreak, to ensure that self-employed UC claimants will receive support.",Uptake thus far unknown; no information yet available,National government,Employees,National funds,"The Chancellor is reported to have met and worked with trade unions and business groups, in order to support peoples' financial security. There is evidence on Hansard (official record of proceedings in Parliament) that the  Chancellor 'spoke to the trade unions' on the 18th of March and on the 19th of March, he met with the TUC, the CBI, the BCC and the FSB. This was done with a view to urgently developing new forms of employment support to help protect people’s jobs and incomes through this period (see https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2020-03-19/debates/8B1662BD-F065-4731-AA48-5BA21424C2D0/Covid-19EmploymentSupport). There are no explicit details of discussion.Previously, the TUC had called for changes to the SSP system. On the 18th of March, the TUC stated that the sick pay system is 'broken', stating that at a maximum of £94.25 per week, Statutory sick pay (SSP) is not enough to live on. The TUC further averred that the average worker earns £512 per week, so for the estimated 7 million people who may come to rely on SSP, any time off work will constitute 'a large income shock.'The TUC also pointed out that many people aren’t eligible for SSP, as approximately 2 million people do not qualify for such payments due to the fact that they do not meet the lower earnings limit of £118 per week. The TUC criticised the Chancellor for not extending eligibility for sick pay to these lower earners; he instead pointed them to the benefit system.

After this crisis, the duration of these eventual contracts will be prolonged for the time they have been suspended.","The suspension of temporary contracts, including training, relief and interim contracts, for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of March 17, will mean the computation will be interrupted, both for the duration of these contracts, as well as the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period, in each of these contractual modalities, with respect to the workers affected by them.Article 5 of RDL 9/2020 provides that the suspension of temporary contracts for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of RDL 8/2020, including training, relief and interim contracts, means the interruption of the computation of both the duration of such contracts as of the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period.Thus, RDL 9/2020 does not indicate that the causes of force majeure, or the economic, technical, organizational or production related to the COVID-19 constitute an enabling budget so that the parties can proceed directly to the suspension of the temporary employment contracts. On the contrary, RDL 8/2020 refers to the suspensions of contracts decided by the company, after confirmation of the force majeure by the competent Labor Authority, or after processing the consultative and negotiating period. Therefore, the paralysis of the effects of the reciprocal obligations of the parties to the temporary contract requires that the causes concur and that the expressed procedural rules have been followed. It is for these assumptions and conditions that it is established that the suspension also has the additional, and exceptional, effect of interrupting the calculation of the term of life or duration of the temporary contract.The norm refers to temporary contracts in general, although it is specified that formative, relief and interim contracts are included.The interruption of the calculation means that the period of suspension of the contract does not count for the purposes of determining neither the agreed term of validity nor the maximum duration. Likewise, although the rule does not make it explicit, it seems logical to conclude that the suspension time does not count either for the purposes of computing the terms of thirty and twenty-four months that are foreseen in application of the limiting rule of the concatenation of temporary contracts in the assumptions of article 15.5 of the Workers Statute.",No data available yet.,National government; Company / Companies,Workers in non-standard forms of employment,No special funding required,There is no evidence available on any involvement of social partners in this case.,No involvement,No involvement,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4152

They requested that opening hours should be limited to 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for the duration of the school closings for retail shops, as the measures would put many of the 400,000 domestic retail employees in a bind and demanded that the opening times in the shops .Initialy, the employers organisation (WKÖ) had rejected the union's demand for a temporary and significant reduction in working hours. 'The trade is fundamentally against any legal shortening of the opening times' said WKÖ trade chairman Peter Buchmüller. The food trade in particular is an important infrastructure for maintaining the security of supply for the entire population and is 'well equipped'. Due to the recent measures by the federal government, the shopping behavior of Austrians has changed. Social partners notice that customers shop less often, but buy more. The customer frequency decreases at a later hour. Therefore, the commercial social partners have agreed to adjust the opening hours accordingly. In a joint protection package for employees and apprentices in the Austrian trade, we have agreed that the shops will be open from Monday, March 23, 2020, from 7:40 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. at the earliest.On 23 March 2020, social partners agreed on a package of measures to protect retail employees.","The social partner agreement finally foresees that retail shops will be open until 7 pm.Further protective measures include that - pregnant employees will be exempted from work- employees belonging to the COVID-19 risk group shall - if possible - be working in areas without client contact.- a tax free treatment of Corona related supplements or rewards; Social parnters appeal to the Federal government to consider this.Initiative of the social partners for uniform standards for the protection of employees in the workplace.

This might include (but will not be limited to) recently retired professionals and students who are near the end of their training. Registered staff can then be used appropriately, with decisions made on a local basis, to increase the available health and social care workforce and enable essential health and care services to function during the height of the epidemic•enable regulators to temporarily add social workers to their registers who may have recently left the profession. This will ensure vital continuity of care for vulnerable children and adults•enable employees and workers to take Emergency Volunteer Leave in blocks of 2, 3 or 4 weeks’ statutory unpaid leave and establish a UK-wide compensation fund to compensate for loss of earnings and expenses incurred at a flat rate for those who volunteer through an appropriate authority. This will ensure that volunteers do not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of performing a public good. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of health and social care services and are particularly important in caring for the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly, those with multiple long-term conditions or those suffering from mental ill-health•provide indemnity for clinical negligence liabilities arising from NHS activities carried out for the purposes of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, where there is no existing indemnity arrangement in place. This will ensure that those providing healthcare service activity across the UK are legally protected for the work they are required to undertake as part of the COVID-19 response. This is in line with and will complement existing arrangements•suspend the rule that currently prevents some NHS staff who return to work after retirement from working more than 16 hours per week, along with rules on abatements and drawn-down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work. This will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and also allow retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.","More than 60,000 retired doctors and nurses who had retired in the last three years were written to and told ""Your NHS Needs You"", urged to come back to the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.  Student nurses and medical students are also being offered temporary work as the health service struggles to cope with rising demand and growing staff shortages.  Officials said those who join the ""NHS Army"" by re-registering with regulators will be assessed to see what kind of help they could offer in the battle against the pandemic.On the 27th of March, retired police officers were also asked to return to work, in either a voluntary or paid capacity. Those officers nearing thirty years' pensionable service have also been asked to delay retirement. The request came as one in five police officers were off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus.  The Met, which is Britain’s biggest force, is already understood to be experiencing absentee rates of 20%. This already high figure came before London hits its peak, with officers and staff missing because they have contracted the virus or are having to self-isolate.Finally, the Government and NHS England called for a 'volunteer army' to help the vulnerable during the coronavirus crisis. Over 750,000 people in just four days signed up the NHS's call for volunteers, three times the original target. On the 7th of April, the Royal Voluntary Service, the charity delivering the volunteer effort, completed checks for the three quarters of a million applications and from the 8th, the NHS Volunteer Responders will support 2.5 million at risk people. Their duties will include: delivering medicines from pharmacies;  driving patients to appointments; bringing them home from hospital; •making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home; and transporting medical supplies and equipment for the NHS.Thousands of these approved volunteers will be offered tasks from the 8th via the GoodSAM app and will start helping people safely, with more expected to get requests over the coming weeks as referrals ramp up.Health professionals, pharmacists and local authorities can upload requests for help on the NHS Volunteer Responders referrer’s portal and volunteers pick the job they want to do that day and close the task once complete.  Volunteers show themselves as available when their app is switched to ‘on duty’.","750,000 volunteers signed up to assist NHS England.	The call for retired NHS staff resulted in 11,788 retired medical staffers returning to work, including 2,660 doctors and 6,147 nurses. In addition, 5,500 final year medical students and 18,000 nursing students will be moved into the front line (FT, 2020). No data on how many police officers have returned to work.No data on costs of measures",National government; Other social actors (e.g. NGOs),Particular professions; Older people ; Other workers & citizens,National funds,It can be assumed that trade unions/professional associations for health care professionals were informed/consulted with but the details of this are not in the public domain.The British Medical Association (BMA) has provided guidance - see https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/covid-19/practical-guidance/covid-19-retired-doctors-returning-to-work,Unknown,No involvement,Yes,Only public sector,O84 Public administration and defence; compulsory social security; Q86 Human health activities,No,,,NHS England NHS army of volunteers to start protecting vulnerable from coronavirus in England; https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/firefighters-retired-emergency-workers-help-tackle-coronavirus-uk#maincontent; https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-bill-what-it-will-do/what-the-coronavirus-bill-will-do; https://www.ft.com/content/46baab28-6def-11ea-89df-41bea055720b; https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/covid-19/practical-guidance/covid-19-retired-doctors-returning-to-work; https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51969104; https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents

","An overview of measures for artists is available on the Federal government's page:https://www.bmkoes.gv.at/Themen/Corona/Corona-Kunst-und-Kultur.htmlIn addition to the general support measures set by government (e.g. Corona short time work: AT-2020-12/229; or the hardship fund for selfemployed AT-2020-12/213), the page also lists specific funds which are only available for artists.This includes, for instance:- COVID-19 fund for artists and intermediaries ('Kulturvermittler');- all artists who are not eligible to apply the hardship fund of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce can bring an application to the KSVF (Artist Social Insurance Fund) from 30 March 2020. The support is intended to compensate for the loss of income caused by closings and cancellations. The COVID 19 fund is endowed with up to €5 million and is intended to ensure rapid aid. In addition to artists, cultural mediators can now apply for this grant. The amount paid out by the KSVF corresponds to that of the hardship fund. A total of a maximum of €6,000 will be paid out - in the first phase up to €1,000 euros, in the second phase up to €2,000 euros per month for a maximum of three months.A separate service page has been set up for loss of income due to the Corona measures: KSVF service fund.Individual funds run by copyright collecting societies (e.g. music, visual arts, film-making, etc.). Seven dedicated funds are also listed on the webpage.In addition to the state instruments for compensating artists' loss of income, there is now also a private initiative. To help artists in the current crisis, foundations have joined together to form the ""Foundations Help Artists"" initiative and are supported by well-known people.Work grants from the City of Vienna due to COVID-19: Since the end of March, freelance artists and freelance scientists with their main residence in Vienna have been able to apply for one-time work grants of up to €3,000. In this crisis situation, there should be the opportunity to continue to pursue artistic and scientific activities (project development, reading, exhibition and lecture preparation and the like).",Not available yet.,National government; Other social actors (e.g. NGOs); Local / regional government,Self-employed ; Solo-self-employed; One person or microenterprises,European Funds; Local funds; National funds; Other,Unknown.,Unknown,Not applicable,Yes,Not specified,"R90 Creative, arts and entertainment activities",Yes,"Legal, social and cultural professionals",,https://www.bmkoes.gv.at/Themen/Corona/Corona-Kunst-und-Kultur.html; https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20200313_OTS0040/akm-und-oestig-richten-kultur-katastrophenfonds-fuer-musikschaffende-ein; https://www.ksvf.at/covid-19.html

Where council clearance processes are considered necessary, to avoid delays, they should be kept as light touch as possible within the governance arrangements of each authority.It also states that council tax reductions should be applied as soon as possible from the beginning of the 2020-21 financial year and billing authorities should rebill council taxpayers as quickly as practical. Authorities will want to make the local population aware of how the grant support package will be delivered, e.g. through providing information on their websites.The Government confirms that it will fund billing authorities in full for the new burdens cost for delivering the support.  Local authorities will wish to maintain a record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms.",Eligibility currently unknown.Cost of measure: £500 million.,National government; Local / regional government,Unemployed; Older people ; The COVID-19 risk group; Disabled; Other workers & citizens,National funds,"As stated previously, the involvement of social partners in devising measures (aside from the furloughing and self-employment schemes) is unknown.

However, as many might not be able to work as usual or might even lose their jobs, the removal of the income ceiling will likely not affect all students.",National government,Particular professions; Unemployed; Youth (18-25); People in care facilities,National funds,N/A,Unknown,Informed,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/03/crisis-package-for-jobs-and-transition/; https://www.csn.se/languages/english/information-about-the-corona-virus.html

Rental leases for these companies cannot be terminated in this period, either, so tenants cannot be evicted, although it is not clear if this means on any grounds at all or whether landlords can exercise some of their rights to terminate.","Under Section 3 of government decree 47/2020, the sectors selected as one most affected by the COVID-19 crisis will receive protection from rent increase or rental contract termination. The measure applies to sectors where businesses typically rent rather than own their premises and where the economic impacts of covid-19 have caused financial strains. Although the measure does not specificy if rental contracts are banned from termination even if no rent is paid by the tenant at all, experts agree that with the eviction ban in place, tenants are likely to get away with not paying at all during the 'state of emergency' period while their business is likely to be closed down.","The measure could affect about 50,000 compaies, mainly SMEs in the COVID-vulnerable sectors. The rule overrides any rent increases stipulated in the rental contract. Legal experts say that if tenants do not pay rent at all, landlords are likely to seek agreement on special terms rather than lose clients on a shrinking property rental market.

The measure is expected to have little impact on the volume of flights. However, the measure is intended as a temporary relief for the airlines during the outbreak of the coronavirus. The purpose of the tax is primarily to provide the state with revenue, but the tax can have an environmental impact by reducing the demand for flights. The Ministry points out that tourism in general and aviation in particular are severely affected by the virus outbreak. Maintaining a fiscal charge on air travel can help exacerbate the negative financial consequences of the virus outbreak.","The duty to pay air passenger tax is incurred when the flight starts from a Norwegian airport, and the fee is calculated per passenger who commences taxable flight from a Norwegian airport. The cancellation of the tax in the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 October 2020 means that the tax will be abolished both for flights made earlier this year and for flights commenced in the period up to and including 31 October 2020. The time of purchase of the air ticket is of no significance for the duty to pay. Flights starting on or after 1 November 2020 will be subject to tax.

The unemployment benefit starts when the unemployed person has been unemployed and has been registered as a real job seeker for at least three of the last fifteen days.

In addition, companies have the opportunity to compensate for wage losses through ""VEU/SVU-allowance"". In addition, there are opportunities to obtain grants from other sources, such as any competency funds, etc.The model was first launched in the service, tourism, hotel and restoration industries, and then the construction and offshore industries were added.

The measure was designed to make working arrangements more flexible for the employer to help protect jobs in companies where business has shut down or work reduced due to the pandemic.","The new measure states that the rules of the Labour Code capping the working time banking period at 4 months (or 6 months in some professions) will now not apply.

These new rules allow for the coverage of: employees with an annual working time account (forfaits jours) in days or hours - i.e. employees whose working hours cannot be fixed in advance (often managers); civil aviation crews, freelance journalists (who are paid for each article ordered); salespeople with the status of sales representatives (VRP); home-based employees paid on a piecework basis; intermittent entertainment workers and models.

The latter is determined by taking into account the difference between the number of days of inactivity recorded and the number of days of inactivity normally guaranteed to the employee over the period in question.

As of 1 April, 61,000 companies, including all the major players in the sector, representing 565,000 employees (i.e. 50% of the profession) had applied for this, according to the DARES.To break the deadlock, the profession has therefore drawn up, under the aegis of the OPPBTP, its professional prevention body managed on an equal footing, this guide which is supposed to 'provide the conditions for employees to continue working in safety'.","Having received the approval of all the ministries concerned, the guide defines the protocols to be respected with the approval of clients and within the framework of social dialogue, the conditions of use of individual protection, respect for barrier gestures, and the procedures to be followed in the event of travel, for example.These measures are capable of ""enabling a gradual resumption of activity"", as all the employers' federations have stressed.

The agreement covers the following issues: telework, full time arranged activity, short-time work, ""fourteen"" and work stoppage. All the measures will apply for the period from 16 March to 30 April 2020, 'possibly with retroactive effect for this period, depending on the situations already in place'.","The main subjects addressed by the agreement are:1/ Use of teleworkingOn a temporary basis and depending on the activity and the technological possibilities available, Daher has set up teleworking ""for a maximum number of group employees whenever possible"". It is up to the manager to regularly assess the workload and the ability of each individual to telework. The manager regularly informs the employee of his or her continued teleworking, or of the possibility of returning to the site ""for service requirements that cannot be carried out remotely"", or of being partially teleworking.2/ Adaptation of work organisationIn some sectors of the company, the work organisation had to be adapted in order to comply with the instructions for taking up work at the post (cleaning, extended or moved lunch break, etc.). In the context of this ""adjusted full-time activity"", the company undertakes, despite a potential reduction in working hours, to maintain employee remuneration, including team bonuses, basket bonuses, meal vouchers or equivalent meal allowance in the absence of closed collective catering, etc. Moreover, ""as a completely exceptional measure and to take into account the commitment of the employees"", the hours not worked due to these adjusted schedules will not give rise to any recuperation.3/ Organisation of short-time working""In accordance with government directives known to date"", ""alternative systems"" to be used before the implementation of the partial activity system are identified in each company. As part of the agreement, and ""subject to the approval of the administration"", the equivalent of a seven-hour day taken as ""time bank/flexible/ reduced working hours (RTT)"" for non-management employees. For managers, one day of RTT (two for metalworking managers) is taken on a mandatory basis. In addition, the agreement continues, the setting of five working days of paid leave over the period of the agreement is imposed.4/ Remuneration during short-time workingIn an approach aimed at preserving purchasing power, Daher raises the remuneration of employees on short-time working to 95% of their net salary, ""instead of the 84% of net salary provided for by law"". In return for this matching contribution and in solidarity with employees whose activity will have been maintained, employees in partial employment will, before December 31, 2020, and as soon as the confinement period has ended, perform up to 25 hours of activity for non-managers and three days for managers, for each full month of partial unemployment. 5/The ""fourteen-week"" periodIn the event that, for safety or health reasons, the employee is sent home at the initiative of the employer or at the request of the client, it is up to the company to find a solution to temporarily offer him/her another assignment or to transfer him/her to another status.For the employee who wishes to take up an assignment at his own initiative ""in a fortnight"" and whose situation is not recognised by the health insurance fund, the company ""shows adaptation and kindness"" to enable him to use as far as possible any other more advantageous arrangement in terms of maintaining remuneration (paid leave, RTT, time bank, flexible, etc.).6/Work stoppageIn the event of a work stoppage (illness, childcare, population at risk at COVID-19, maternity, etc.), the employee benefits from the compensation scheme provided for, via the daily social security benefits and the employer's supplement set according to the Daher Group.

The agreement provides that they may be reduced by up to 50% of the theoretical workforce, with a minimum of 2 employees per sector. Over the period, the management must draw up a provisional schedule for the composition of the teams, ensuring that there are rotations between employees. In the event of an unforeseen additional absence, one or more employees may be called in to complete the team. In any event, the provisional schedule is adapted on a daily basis to take into account any changes in the situation.The employees affected by this reduction in activity shall not suffer any loss of remuneration and shall be paid at the normal time, 'as if they had worked full time according to their usual working hours'. In other words, the agreement specifies that the rest days imposed on certain employees will be considered as actual working time for the calculation of remuneration elements.In addition, to limit physical contact, the agreement provides that employees travelling to the sites may travel with their personal vehicle. These trips are financed by the company in the form of mileage allowance payments on the June 2020 payroll at the latest.  All STMicroelectronics employees other than Manufacturing and Production Support who travel to their place of work at the request of their management are also eligible for this measure.Finally, a systematic temperature reading can be taken at the entrance to the sites. In the event that the temperature exceeds a limit set by the central health, safety and working conditions commission (CSSCT) and the occupational physician coordinating France, employees are invited to go home and consult their treating physician or log on to the health insurance website to obtain a work stoppage.","The agreement applies to production workers of STMicroelectronics which employs about 10,100 people in France.

But it also underlines the right of everyone to preserve their health and to work safely. Faced with contradictory demands, the signatories call for an appropriate social dialogue in companies. They add that they would like company negotiations to be favoured so that the branch agreement plays exclusively its supplementary role, in accordance with the Labour Code. The agreement of 3 April 2020 does not therefore call into question the company agreements already signed, nor the company negotiations currently underway.Short-time workingThe agreement invites companies to ""seek with the social partners, beyond the preservation of employment, a change in the conditions of compensation"" for short-time working, ""to mitigate its negative impacts"" (on the purchasing power of employees).The agreement recalls that the period of short-time working can be used for training actions. It adds that when occupational health and safety conditions are ""irreproachable, guaranteed and applied"", the training action can be implemented ""in situ"", within the company, if necessary, in a work situation. In this context, the joint body in charge of vocational training (OPCO 2i) is invited to provide collective training actions for employees of VSEs and SMEs.

It targets enterprises in the horti- and agricultural sectors as a whole because this sector was one of the first to feel a marked hit from the crisis. This includes the provision of food and other grown products, not just for domestic consumption but also for trade. The seasonality of work in this sector and the timing of the COVID-19 crisis seem to have led to this group of enterprises receiving specific support.","The sectors covered here by this measure include the agriculture and horticulture sector, the fisheries sector, and the aquaculture sector. These sectors are all confronted by an international and domestic decrease in demand for their produce.The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit - LNV), will therefore temporarily underwrite working capital granted to farms and horticultural companies under the the Guarantee for Agricultural SME Credit, (Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten), which is part of the Guarantee SME Loans scheme for small and medium-sized farms and enterprises.In this way, the government will act as a guarantor for loans granted to farms.

Workers and technicians in short-time working will thus be paid 92% of their net salary, instead of the 84% provided for by the legal system. This is made possible by the solidarity of managers on partial unemployment, whose net pay will increase from 100% to 92%.","Applicable until July 3, 2020, this agreement was put in place, thanks to the solidarity of managers and an additional contribution from the company, to erase the disparities in compensation between the different categories of employees, resulting from the legal provisions and the collective agreement of the Metallurgy. The agreement brings the remuneration of all employees to 92% of their usual net remuneration. According to the President of Renault Trucks France, ""this agreement makes it possible to treat all employees fairly during this unprecedented period of crisis. It offers each employee who wishes to do so, the opportunity to approach 100% of his or her remuneration through the use of days off, while safeguarding the future of the company.

Three axes are planned to achieve this objective: the creation of a ""social solidarity"" mechanism to supplement the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity situations; the possibility of adapting the programming of holidays in each establishment; the implementation of a reinforced protocol of barrier gestures. The agreement is applicable until October 31, 2020. The provisions concerning the creation of a solidarity fund will cease on 30 April 2020.","The main content of the measure consist of:1. Solidarity Fund""Since March 16, 2020, all the activities of the group's industrial and commercial system have been stopped, which has led the company to place the vast majority of staff under the partial activity regime"", according to the agreement, which emphasizes that managers or technicians on fixed-days contracts already benefit from contractual provisions allowing them to maintain their remuneration in the event of partial unemployment. In order to enable all professional categories (employees, workers and technicians, managers on lump-sum hours) to benefit from guaranteed remuneration for the period from 16 March to 30 April, the agreement sets up a solidarity fund. The fund will be financed by the payment of two days' leave for managers and one day for workers and technicians. Employees will be able to voluntarily pay the remainder of their paid leave that could not be used before May 31, 2020. For its part, PSA Automobiles undertakes to top up the days paid into the fund by 40%. These payments should make it possible to maintain employees' remuneration for a full month for 100% of the workforce. In the event that the partial activity is extended to all or part of the company's establishments, priority will be given to voluntary payments. If necessary, an additional number of days may be deducted. This may be done by half-day (excluding paid holidays) ""to adjust as best as possible to the gradual takeover of the sites"", up to a limit of 0.5 days for workers and technicians and one day for managers.2. Arrangement of paid holidaysThe agreement takes into account Order No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020 allowing for the adaptation of the terms and conditions for taking paid holidays. Thus, each head of establishment will be able to impose the taking of six working days of leave during the period of partial activity, from 7 April to 31 October 2020. This week of paid leave may be taken either consecutively if the site's activity has been completely suspended, or non-consecutively if the site's activity is partially maintained.With regard to the setting of the weeks of paid summer holidays, each head of establishment will also be able to adjust their positioning, provided that each employee is guaranteed at least 12 consecutive working days over the period between 1 July and 31 August. In this context, the agreement provides for priority in the choice of dates for employees whose spouses cannot change their departure dates, for single-parent families, and for employees working 100% during the period of partial activity in their establishment. The latter will also be able to keep the previously set dates, or take three consecutive weeks of leave. In addition, their unused leave balance as of May 31, 2020 may exceptionally be carried forward until December 31, 2020. Finally, the agreement specifies that all employees who have not been able to take their remaining paid leave before May 31, 2020, due to the resumption of activity or the needs of the establishments, will be able to take these days until July 31, 2020.3. An enhanced security protocolThe agreement recalls that, since the start of the health crisis at Covid-19, PSA Automobiles has adopted a reinforced health protocol of barrier gestures (wearing of masks on site, respect of distances with floor markings, ventilation of work spaces, longer break times for hand washing, etc.). Currently being rolled out at all industrial, commercial, service and engineering sites, these measures are subject to internal audits and assessment by health and safety committees to ensure their ""perfect"" implementation. A presentation of the audit reports as well as a field trip with members of the staff representative bodies will make it possible to share these conclusions, to assess their content and to correct, if necessary, the measures taken locally. In addition, management undertakes to implement communication and awareness-raising actions associated with the deployment of the enhanced security protocol.","The agreement applies to about 68,000 employees in France.",Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees,Companies; Employees; National funds,"The agreement has been signed by four representative trade unions (CFDT, CFTC, CFE-CGC and FO), excepted the CGT.",Direct consultation,Negotiated,Yes,Only private sector,"C29 Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers",No,,,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiQ3eTP66bpAhWPwMQBHc0SDYsQFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.industriall-europe.eu%2Fcontent%2Fdocuments%2Fupload%2F2020%2F4%2F637224848804873772_PSA-accord-social-solidaire-protecteur-de-la-sant%25C3%25A9-des-salari%25C3%25A9s-et-de-lentreprise.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1VLW_b5H7cCy8PwY5UYVe
