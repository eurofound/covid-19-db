This was complementary to other measures, [see case AT-2020-12-/229](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NL-2020-12_229), as those two target groups would not be able to profit from the short-time working schemes.","The support is a one-off payment and does not have to be paid back. In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:* **Phase 1**: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is €500 if the net income p.a. was below €6,000 and €1,000 if it was above €6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is €33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accommodation rents) and freelance workers.* **Phase 2**: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at €2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.All applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to €6,000. In general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 January 2021. ","Information from 1 April 2020: Around 100,000 applications for phase 1 were counted so far. The total funds for the hardship fund were increased from €1 to 2 billion.Information from 20 April 2020: The first phase has been completed with 144,000 applications made. A total of €121 million. was paid out in the first phase. As of mid-September 2020, a total of almost 195,000 people have been supported in phases one and two and around €528.7 million have been paid out. In the most recent period under review (mid-July to mid-August), an average of around €1,200 was paid out in each case.As of mid-October 2020, around 203,000 people have applied for assistance from the Corona hardship fund since the beginning and €700 million have been spent. On average, €1,200 were paid per individual in the period between 16 September and 15 October 2020. According to a survey conducted in July and August 2020 by KMU Research Austria, 57 percent of one-person enterprises have taken advantage of government support measures in connection with the COVID-19 crisis. Of these, almost all entrepreneurs have applied for the hardship fund. Significantly fewer have also applied for tax and duty deferrals (36%), installment payments or deferrals of social security contributions (35%) and fixed cost subsidies (29%). Data from March 2021 show that so far, €1.22 billion (of the total budget of €2 billion) have been paid or committed.

Also the costs for issuing the bank guarantees (1% administration fee and 0.8% recurring provision) will be covered by the state. The financial measures are administered by the specialised Austrian Bank for Tourism (OHT).In addition, some regional states (Bundeslaender) have declared they they will support companies by taking on the payment of interest on the loans and some banks have announced they will keep interest rates low (at 1%).

As such measures required many self-employed individuals to close their businesses or restricted their ability to make a living, the scheme was introduced to bring support in line that available to employees under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.","On 26 March 2020 the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme was announced to allow certain groups of self-employed individuals to claim a taxable cash grant worth 80% of average monthly trading profits over the last three years up to a maximum of €2,820 (GBP 2,500) for three months (could be extended). The grant will be subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions but does not need to be repaid. This is intended to match the protection provided to employed individuals, thus covering this group for the first time. The scheme is run directly through Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) which contacts eligible individuals from May 2020 onwards.On 29 May the Government announced a second round of the SEISS, with those eligible able to claim a second grant, worth 70% of their average monthly trading profit, for a further three months, capped at £6,570 in total. On 2 July a second Treasury Direction was published to this effect. Applications for the second grant were opened on 17 August, and were closed on 19 October.On 24 September the Government announced an extension to the SEISS to be introduced in November, to cover the six months up to the end of April 2021. The SEISS Grant Extension would be made in two taxable grants – first to cover November to January, second to cover February to April.  Initially it was proposed that the first of these grants would cover 20% of average monthly trading profits, capped at £1,875, but this figure has been revised three times.  On 22 October the Chancellor announced the first grant would cover 40% of average monthly trading profits, capped at £3,750. On 2 November the Chancellor announced that the payment for the first month (November) of the first grant would be set at 80% – increasing the total level of this grant to 55% of trading profits, capped at £5,160. Subsequently on 5 November the Chancellor announced that all three months of the first grant would be calculated on the basis of 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of £7,500.[1]On 24 November the Government published a further Treasury Direction underpinning the scheme. Applications for the third SEISS grant opened on 29 November and are to close on 29 January 2021.There is to be a fourth round; details of this will be announced on 3 March 2021.","Following the criticism that businesses are likely to have to wait five weeks for first payments to be made (the delay is partly to accommodate firms having to file tax returns - required to be able to claim the benefit) and that the wait may be difficult for businesses already struggling, the Government has released data as to the take-up and cost of the scheme up to the end of June 2020.3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the income and trading activity criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment returns from 2018-19 and earlier years. However, some of these businesses will not have continued trading since 2018-19 or will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus so will not be eligible.* On the 13 May, there had been 441,000 claims made, with a total value of GBP 1.3 billion. * By the 31 May, the total number of claims was 2.5 million, with a value of GBP 7.2 billion. * By the 30 June, the total number of SEISS claims was 2.6 million (75% of the potentially eligible population), with a value of GBP 7.7 billion. The average value per claim was GBP 2,900.Around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m). A lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (70%) compared to males (78%). The average claim for females is also lower at GBP 2,300 compared to the average claim for males of GBP 3,200. By 30 June, HMRC had received 1,805,000 claims from men totaling GBP 5.7bn compared to 745,000 claims from women for GBP 1.7bn.Around 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 75%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.  The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (60% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at GBP 3,300. The youngest age group have the second lowest take up rate (68%) and the lowest average claim value at GBP 2,100.The sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 30 June, construction workers had made 867,000 claims for SEISS totaling GBP 3.1bn, an average of GBP3,500 per claimant.  Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 221,000 claims totaling GBP 481m. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 193,000 claims totaling GBP 399m.The two regions with the highest number of claims are London (484,000) and the South East (373,000), reflecting their relative sizes.On the 18 September, a further update on take-up of the scheme was published. The data covers the period up to the 31 August. Around 5 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and had their data assessed for potential SEISS eligibility. In order to be assessed, a self-employed individual needed to have traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted a Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year. Via this process then, 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the criteria for the scheme based on Self Assessment returns from the tax year 2018 to 2019 and earlier years. However, some of the potentially eligible businesses will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus or have ceased trading since the tax year 2018 to 2019 so will not have been eligible.The updated data shows that:* by 31 August, 2.0 million (60%) of the potentially eligible population had claimed a second SEISS grant with the value of these claims totalling GBP 5.1 billion* the average value per claim was GBP 2,500* around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3 million). A lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (54%) compared to males (62%)* the average claim for females is also lower at GBP 2,000 compared to the average claim for males of GBP 2,700* around 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 56%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread* the sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 31 August, construction workers had made 693,000 claims for SEISS totalling GBP 2.1bn* the two regions with the highest number of claims are London (390,000) and the South East (292,000), reflecting their relative sizes* of the 1.6 million that did not meet the SEISS criteria, 1.4 million (87%) had trading profits less than non-trading profits (eg. income from employment or investment income), 0.5 million (33%) had trading profits of GBP 0 or made a loss and 0.2 million (11%) had trading profits over GBP 50,000. (N.B. Individuals may be counted more than once if they have trading profits which meet more than one of these criteria which explains why the figures sum to more than 1.6 million)The latest data (November 2020) show that:* around 5 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and had their data assessed for potential SEISS eligibility.

The objective is to ease the financing of business credits for companies, whose revenues and profits have been affected due to the stop of orders, deliveries or other changes of the economic environment, as a consequence of the Corona crisis. A newly simplified and speedy process for the acceptance of these guarantees has been implemented.","The measure is targeted at small and medium sized companies and one -person enterprises (less than 250 employees, max. €50 million turnover or €43 million balance sheet sum); operating in all sectors (whereby for tourism, a separate package has been set up, which is administered by a different institution.

The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ","The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees’ (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to €2,820 (GBP 2,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.Employers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.","The scheme has been criticised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures). The scheme is set to be up and running by the end of April 2020 with the possibility of claiming payments in arrears.By the 19 July (the latest available data), the total number of jobs furloughed was 9.5 million, with 1.2 million employers utilising the scheme, at a total cost to the government of GBP 29.8 billion (HM Government, 2020).On the 18 September, the Government published data on the scheme's operation up until the 31 July (although figures for 31 July are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received). The main findings are that: * following on from the last release which covered the period to 30 June, preliminary estimates show that furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to the 31 July;* since the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on the 8 May, followed by reductions in June, preliminary figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July to 4.8 million on the 31 July - it is estimated that this figure could be in the region of 10% higher, or around 5.3 million once all returns are received and revisions made;* furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on the 24 April at 1.85 million employments - by the 31 July, initial figures show 789,000 jobs furloughed in this sector – a decrease of more than a half since the peak for the sector;* across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between the 30 June and the 31 July:* as at the 31 July, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furloughed that were actually furloughed was arts, entertainment and recreation at 45% followed by accommodation and food services sector at 43% - in all, 58% of employers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of July and 57% of employers in accommodation and food services;* overall, where it was possible to link the CJRS data on individual furloughed employments to other data, for the UK as a whole, 2.26 million women were furloughed at the end of July compared with 2.15 million men;* preliminary estimates show there was broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of July; London had the highest take-up rate of 17% against the UK average of 16%;* in most countries and regions, more women than men were furloughed at the 31 July, the greatest exception to this being the West Midlands where 187,000 women were furloughed as opposed to 197,000 men;* almost 200,000 employers were using flexible furlough at the end of July for at least one job;  in total, over 950,000 employments were on flexible furlough at the end of July, around 20% of all furloughed employments;* at 29%, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed flexibly;* based on the preliminary data for the 31 of July, the South West has the highest proportion of employments on flexible furlough at 25% and London has the highest proportion of employments furloughed on a full-time basis at 82%. As of the 13 December, the total value of claims made by that date was £46.6 billion. The  Government released the most recent data on the scheme in December 2020. The main points from the analysis, covering the period to 31 October are that: * furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to 31 October since the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on 8 May, followed by reductions in June, * figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July, August and September to 5.4 million at 31 July and 3.8 million at 31 August and 2.8 million at 30 September.* Latest figures show that the number of employments has continued to fall throughout October to 2.4 million at 31 October. This is a reduction of 73% from the peakfurloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.9 million employments. * At 31 October, there were 356,400 employments furloughed in this sector – a decrease of more than 80% since the peak for the sector* As at 31 October, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furlough that were actually furloughed was the accommodation and food services sector at 27% followed by arts, entertainment and recreation at 24%. In all, 45% of employers in both the accommodation and food services sector and the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of October* Across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between 30 September and 31 October* Overall, where it was possible to link the data, across the UK, 1.19 million women were furloughed at 31 October compared with 1.14 million men.

To cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the Government, via the Prime Minister's Decree of 4 March 2020, simplified the conditions to apply the smart working regime (lavoro agile) to the workforce. The goal is to encourage companies to employ this job scheme to ensure, when possible, business continuity.","Article 1, lett. n) of the Prime Minister's Decree of 4 March 2020 authorises the adoption of the smart working regime without executing, with the employees, the individual agreement required by the law in normal conditions. This individual agreement contains, in general, significant dispositions steering the performance under the smart working regime, like the rules implementing the right to disconnect. Moreover, Article 1, lett. n) specifies that the informative obligations bearing on the employer according to Law No. 81 of 2017 can be fulfilled, while the measure is into force, through electronic communications.All the workers that can realise their performance working remotely are eligible, provided that the employer wants to activate this scheme.Law Decree No. 18 of 17 March 2020, converted into law No. 27 of 24 April 2020, further intervened on the issue of smart working: Until the end of the state of emergency, workers with disabilities or who have a person with a disability in their family unit, have the right to smart working, provided it is compatible with the characteristics of their activity. In addition, the Law Decree states that, in accepting requests to smart working, priority has to be given to workers in the private sector with reduced working capacity.",No data are available yet on the use of the measure.,National government; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,No special funding required,"Main employer's and workers' organisations welcomed the measure.Social partners have not been involved in the preparatory works of this measure.Smart working is currently the focus of a significant public debate. The research centre of the trade union CGIL carried out a survey on workers' experience of smart working during the emergency. According to the results of the survey [When working from home is smart](http://www.cgil.it/smart-working-cgil-lunedi-presentazione-indagine-con-landini-e-camusso/), several critical issues emerge in workers' experience of smart working. The former secretary of CGIL, Susanna Camusso, now responsible of gender policies in the trade union, highlighted the profound gender differences in experiencing the smart working, arguing that smart working cannot be seen as a form of work-life balance only for women, as they are more penalized and discriminated against, both on the relational and the purely professional front. Moreover, she argued that rules are needed to make it a truly smart job and not a transposition of a Fordist job within the walls of the house. Also the General Secretary of the union commented on the research arguing that in order to be a positive and satisfying experience for women and men, smart working must be organized and bargained with trade unions, and issues such as the right to disconnection and training need to be adequately addressed.

Short-time work has been a well established crisis measure for a long time and was last used to a great extent during the 2008/09 financial crisis, alleviating the economic downturn to quite some extent. See for example a [Eurofound report from 2010](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2010/austria/working-conditions-labour-market-business/austria-short-time-working-subsidy).","A short-time work scheme applies if a company temporarily reduces the working time. In order to prevent dismissals and to protect businesses and employees from negative economic and social impacts of COVID-19, social partners (Chamber of Labour, Trade Unions, Economic Chamber) negotiated the current scheme. Working hours of employees can be reduced up to zero hours keeping full / almost full pay. The employer only pays for the actual working time. Reduced working hours: The reduced standard working hours must be on average between 10% and 90% of the collectively agreed working hours (this applies to (pre-short-time work) full-time workers, an aliquot reduction applies to employees who were on part-time before short-time work). A new aspect of this is that it may temporarily also be set at zero. Thus, for instance, in the context of a short-time working period of six weeks, it may be set at 0% for five weeks (i.e. no work will take place, and for one week at 60%). Another important point to note is that, in some business sectors, the agreement on short-time work may also include overtime.For persons with a disability (registered disabled persons according to the Act on the Employment of People with Disabilities (BEinstG), a special job security subsidy applies when making use of the PES' short-time work model. The employers are reimbursed for the remaining wage costs after deduction of the PES short-time work subsidy for the duration of the short-time work. Prerequisites are an application for short-time work (even retroactive) by 30 June 2020 and the existence of a degree of disability of at least 50% (notice of assessment), as well as no existing wage subsidies for the disabled person concerned.","As of 14 April 2020, short-time work applications have been made for the jobs of 608,607 people, in mid-May, over 1.3 million people were on short-time work.The funds have been increased several times, from originally €3 billion to currently (mid-June) €12 billion in mid-May.The Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth maintains a regularly updated [webpage on labour market statistics](https://www.bmafj.gv.at/Services/News/Aktuelle-Arbeitsmarktzahlen.html), which keeps track of the number of people currently in short-time work. Peak numbers were reached during three weeks in May, during which time more than 1.3 million people were on short-time work. Numbers remained above 400,000 during the summer months and declined to 290,696 on 28 September 2020.On 6 October 2020, according to a newspaper article by 'DiePresse', the financial police had carried out inspections in 13,829 companies for a total of 6,145 hours, primarily to check compliance with the short-time working rules.

FI-2020-15/254,Temporary recognition of entrepreneurs as recipients of labour market subsidy,Yrittäjien väliaikainen oikeus työttömarkkinaturvaan,Finland,Applies nationwide,04/08/2020,06/30/2021,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,New aspects included into existing measure,Income protection beyond short-time work,Extensions of  income support to workers not covered by any kind of protection scheme,04/03/2020,"In Finland, full-time entrepreneurs are normally not entitled to labour market support (in Finnish 'työmarkkinaturva'). This is regulated in section 11 of  the Unemployment Security Act (Työttömyysturvalaki) (2002/1290). Labour market subsidy is a form of unemployment benefit aimed for unemployed persons entering the labour market for the first time or who do not qualify for the basic or earnings-related unemployment allowance (in Finnish 'työttömyyspäiväraha'). The outbreak of COVID-19 has had a major impact on entrepreneurial activities in Finland. In order to ease the pressure caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 on entrepreneurs, the Parliament approved an amendment that will give entrepreneurs a temporary right to labour market support under the Unemployment Security Act (2002/1290).  ","To be eligible for labour market support, the following conditions must be met: 1. the entrepreneur's full-time employment has ended or the income from the entrepreneurial activities is less than €1,089 per month2. the reduction of income or full-time work is due to the COVID-19 outbreak The entrepreneur may continue their business activities while receiving labour market support. The support can be paid to entrepreneurs between 16 March 2020 and 30 June 2020. The support can be received retroactively. The labour market support is €33.6 per day and it is paid 5 days a week. Income from entrepreneurial activities decreases the labour market support. ","In total 32,600 entrepreneurs received labour market subsidy in April and May 2020. Over half of the recipients were over 45 years old. A majority of them were women but there are no significant differences between women and men. By the end of May 2020, in total €35.5 million was paid out to entrepreneurs. As of 26 August 2020, in total 48,000 applications had been made and 41,000 entrepreneurs have received labour market subsidy. The numbers of entrepreneurs applying has decreased significantly since the spring and summer months. KELA, the social insurance institution that pays out the subsidy, has been receiving approximately 300 applications per week. In 2020, in total 44,000 entrepreneurs received labour market subsidy. The total amount paid out by KELA was €165,7 million.According to a survey made by the Federation of Finnish Enterprises (Suomen Yrittäjät) in November 2020, especially entrepreneurs in the trade sector and entrepreneurs employing 1-4 persons have applied for labour market subsidy. ",National government; Public employment service; Social insurance,Self-employed,National funds,"Due to urgency of the epidemic, no round of comments was organised. Temporary recognition of entrepreneurs are recipients of labour market subsidy was not part of the measures the peak level social partners presented to the government in March 2020. The Federation of Finnish Entrepreneurs (Suomen Yrittäjät) welcomes this measure and extensions to it. According to the organisation, access to labour market subsidy helps tens of thousands of entrepreneurs to get through the most critical months of the COVID-19 crisis. In November 2020, the Federation of Finnish Entrepreneurs said the Government's plan to extend the duration of this measure by three months (until March 2021) is too short and it would have been better to extend the duration of this measure by six months. In February 2021, the Federation of Finnish Entrepreneurs welcomed the new extension of this measure (until the end of June 2021) and argued that this support has been crucial for many entrepreneurs. However, they would like the Government to introduce a specific form of support for solo self-employed. ",Not applicable,No involvement,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://tem.fi/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/yrittajille-oikeus-tyottomyysturvaan-koronavirusepidemian-vuoksi; https://akava.fi/en/general-en/social-partners-proposals-to-help-businesses-in-the-corona-crisis/; https://www.kela.fi/tyottomyysturva-yrittaja; https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/vaski/HallituksenEsitys/Sivut/HE_35+2020.aspx; https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/vaski/HallituksenEsitys/Sivut/HE_93+2020.aspx; https://valtioneuvosto.fi/documents/1410877/16402203/Korona_tilannekuva_TEM_1.9.2020-final.pdf/38cb4dae-0e83-db97-7c37-3cbb77086acd/Korona_tilannekuva_TEM_1.9.2020-final.pdf?t=1599040943409; https://www.yrittajat.fi/uutiset/638664-yrittajan-valiaikainen-tyottomyysturva-jatkuu-maaliskuun-loppuun-fysioterapeutille#fcc9e791; https://valtioneuvosto.fi/-/1410877/hallitus-esittaa-yrittajien-tyomarkkinatuelle-jatkoa-kesakuun-loppuun?languageId=en_US; https://www.yrittajat.fi/uutiset/642436-yrittajan-tyottomyysturvalle-jatkoa-kesakuun-loppuun-pentikainen-yrittajan#f8f4ac9c

The total amount for COVID II programme was CZK 4,000,000,000 (€145,190,563).","The measure run under the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness (Operační program Podnikání a inovace pro konkurenceschopnost, [OPPIK](https://www.mpo.cz/en/business/grants-and-business-support/opeic-2014-2020/operational-programme-enterprise-and-innovations-for-competitiveness-2014---2020--169167/). The loan was aimed at SMEs with trade permission in Czech Republic (except of Prague region) who were forced due to approved anti-COVID-19 measures to shut down or limit their businesses. Business activity of the SME had to be included at the supported economic activities list, which was, however, very wide and included accommodation, logistics, manufacturing industry etc. ČMZRB secured the commercial loan up to 80% with the maximum period of 3 years. SME could also apply for financial support on the loan interest up to CZK 1,000,000 (€36,298 approx.). Loan to be secured were limited to CZK 15,000,000 (€544,465). The loans were intended to cover salaries, rent, utility costs and supplier-customer invoices. The program was financed from the EU Structural Funds within the OPPIK and was therefore not intended for the implementation of projects in the capital city of Prague. Financial support for projects implemented in Prague can be applied for in the COVID Prague guarantee program.","According to [Czech National Bank (Česká národní banka, ČNB)], as of 15 December 2020, 3,141 applications were supported from the COVID II programme in the total amount of CZK 14,076,000,000 (€539,620,472 approx.).No evaluation or information on effectiveness is available by now, however, there has been a lot of criticism of COVID I and COVID II measures. The Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic (Hospodářská komora České republiky) conducted  a survey among its members in April 2020, who highlighted the tangle of bureaucracy and lack of clarity in the COVID I and COVID II. To apply, companies needed to complete complex forms forecasting the next three years, which is an impossibility in the current situation. Also the capacity of Czech-Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank (Českomoravská záruční a rozvojová banka, ČMZRB), when approving the loans, was very low and the process too long.",National government; Company / Companies,SMEs,European Funds; National funds,"Partially in agreement.

Funds are forwarded to employers who are in turn obliged to forward these to their employees. Full time employees in specific sectors will receive €800 a month from the government through their employers. As part of the agreement, employers in these sectors will continue providing their workers with a further €400 a month. Employers who were too highly impacted by the pandemic and cannot afford the further €400 must register with the Department of industrial relations. ","Full time employees working in organisations that operate in sectors severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, or on order of the Superintendent of Public Health had to suspend their operations are entitled up to five days salary based on a monthly wage of €800. This is also applicable to self-employed individuals. Part-time employees are eligible for €500 a month. The sectors that can apply for this supplement are under constant review and are listed on the Malta Enterprise website (Annex A). In other sectors also thought to have been hit by the pandemic but to a lesser degree, the list of which are also available on the Malta Enterprise website (Annex B), full time and part-time employees are entitled to the equivalent of one days' salary per week, set at €160 per month and €100 per month, respectively. Those in Gozo are entitled to two days' salary per week; €320 per month for full-time and €200 per month for part-time employees.  Full-time self-employed in sectors thought to have been hit but to a lesser degree who have employees will receive €320 per month, part-time self employed €200 per month. Full-time self-employed based in Gozo in these same sectors will also be entitled to €320 per month but will rise to  €480 if they employ staff, and the employees will be entitled to two days salary. Part-time self-employed in Gozo will be entitled to €200, rising to €300 if they employ staff. The employees will receive two days salary. In July 2020, the sectors in Annex A were reviewed and reduced. Those sectors previously supported by this scheme but not included in the updated Annex A will from July 2020 receive a wage supplement of €600 for full time workers and up to €375 for part time workers, termed Annex C. It was also announced in July 2020 that pensioners and students who were registered as employed with JobsPlus since the 9 March, may now also be considered for the Wage supplement. These were previously ineligible.","By the end of May it was announced that €55 million had been disbursed, saving 93,580 jobs. A further €25 million was expected to be distributed by the beginning of June.By mid-September 2020, the Malta Enterprise CEO announced that €200 million had been spent on this measure. Furthermore, around 85% of those who benefitted from the measure were micro, small and medium enterprises.A September 2020 study by the Malta Employers Association which was conducted amongst its members found that the COVID-19 wage supplement was rated as the most effective financial measure with 62% rating it as effective.In mid-September 2020, the measure had cost €200 million. This amounts to almost the entire €215 million budget approved by the EU Commission under the State Aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020. However, this figure needs to be treated with caution, as various ministers and stakeholders mentioned different sums.It was announced in parliament that by the end of January 2021, the Malta Enterprise had received 21,855 applications for this scheme. Most applications fell under Annex A (14,987), whilst 3,465 fell under Annex B. The remaining 3,403 were not eligible. Of the approved applications, these covered 92,443 workers, of which 54,101 were full time and 10,662 part-time in Annex A, whilst 25,020 were full-time and 2,660 part-time in Annex B. The total cost of the scheme was almost €350 million.In May 2021 it was announced that the total budget for this measure had now been increased from the original €215 million to €750 million. It was also stated that €360 million had been spent on the measure in 2020 and that a further 70 million had been spent in the first two months of 2021, however this sum also included the cost of other measures such as the rent and electricity subsidy scheme.",National government; Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Employers' organisations,Sector specific set of companies; Other businesses,European Funds; National funds,"Consultation was carried out in the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (MCESD), a tripartite body, with the government announcing that agreement was reached in this forum.Employer associations were vocal in the press following the official announcement stating their agreement with the new measures. Some employers in sectors which have not been included in the measures have also been vocal in the press that their workers should also be included. These include those in marketing and real estate. In March 2021, the outgoing President of the Malta Chamber, an employer's association, noted that the wage supplement could make 'businesses lazy' and that the money spent on this measure would only be an investment if organisations also re-engineered so as to face the new realities that COVID-19 had brought. He therefore pushed for re-engineering plans to be carried out in tandem.

No interest or penalties are to be charged with regards to the eligible taxes. The scheme is targeted at those who have suffered a significant downturn in turnover due to COVID-19. ","This measure originally applied to taxes owed until the end of April; tax forms were still expected to be submitted according to normal deadlines. The incentive was primarily aimed at companies and self-employed who suffer a significant downturn in their turnover. A sum of a reduction in 25% is quoted and it aims to target the following sectors but is not limited to them:  tourism and hospitality, entertainment, transport, and manufacturing sectors.  Enterprises will still collect National Insurance on their employees’ wages, but will keep these dues for the duration of the deferral. The eligible taxes to be deferred are those due in March and April 2020 and include: provisional tax, employee taxes, maternity fund payments and social security contributions, social security contributions of self-employed persons and VAT.Eligible taxes, other than VAT, are to be settled in 4 equal monthly installments between May and August 2020. VAT is to be settled in 2 equal installments with the 2 quarterly returns that follow the deferred quarter. Excluded from this initiative are companies and self-employed persons who failed to comply with their tax obligations by 31 December 2019. Applications were to be entered by 15th April 2020It was later announced that the period covered by this measure was extended by a further two months, to cover up until the end of June. After this period some contributions will no longer be deferred. National Insurance, income tax and maternity contributions will need to be paid from 1 July. However, other taxes due by organisation have been deferred to the end of August. Companies can pay the deferred tax by May next year, with no interest charged.","Up until the end of May 2020, 3,324 businesses had their application for tax deferral approvedamounting to an estimated total of around €60 million being deferred. The Ministry for Finance and Financial Services by means of their October 2020 Economic Survey stated that during the first eight months of 2020, tax revenue decreased by 22.1%, reaching €2,216.6 million as direct tax revenues fell by €308.1 million, indirect taxes declined by €321.6 million and non-tax revenues declined by €35.6 million. The proceeds from income tax decreased by 22.0 per cent while social security contributions declined by 11.3%. These declines were in-part due to Government measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic including the deferral of provisional tax, employee taxes, maternity fund payments and social security contributions, social security contributions for self-employed persons and Value Added Tax (VAT) between March and June 2020. National insurance, income tax and maternity contributions have started to be paid from 1 July 2020. Other taxes due by companies have been deferred to the end of August 2020. Companies may pay the deferred tax by May 2021, with no interest charged.In 2020, a total of €230 million in taxes were deferred, by March 2021 just under €100 million had been settled.",National government,Self-employed,National funds,"Employer organisations and other social partners initially consulted the government individually. Employers were not initially pleased when this measure was announced as it was felt to be insufficient. The measure was one of the first to be announced, whilst wage supplements were what social partners were pushing for. Wage supplements were later announced by the government (covered in a separate case). In November 2020, the President of the Republic Street Business Community Association (Employer's Association representing the main shopping street of Valletta, Malta's Capital) stated that whilst deferral (and other government initiatives) aided their enterprises, taxes would still need to be paid despite organisations having no return during this period, whilst still having to pay other costs such as salaries and rent.

The employee will thus receive a sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency from the first day of his incapacity for work. This change was implemented by Act no. 63/2020 Coll, amending Act no. 461/2003 Coll on social insurance and Act no. 311/2001 Coll Labor Code","According to the local legal framework, in normal conditions the employee receives, during the first 10 days of incapacity to work, an income compensation directly from the employer. Only after 10 days, the employee receive a sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency. Self-employed insured persons are, then, entitled to a sick benefit for the first three days of 25% and subsequently in the amount of 55% of the assessment base.On the basis of the new COVID-19 related measure, the employer will not pay wage compensation in the case of employee's illness or if it is quarantined in reason of the epidemic, during the first 10 days of sick leave. Indeed, it will be paid by the Social Insurance Agency.Self-employed as well receives full sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency from the first day of sick leave (i.e. not 25% during the first three days).This measure is proposed in an effort to relieve the undertakings in times of crisis of costs related to temporary incapacity for work, as well as to increase the income of insured persons in cases of ordered quarantine measures and isolation.","As far as the costs of the Social Insurance Agency are concerned, they are estimated that 100,000 sickness benefits will be paid out in 2020. Beyond the current legal status, the sickness benefits will be paid to the persons concerned from the Social Insurance Agency for ten calendar days. The average assessment base of the person concerned is assumed to be at the level of the average wage of 2019, i.e. €1,092, as sickness benefits are basically based on the previous year's income. Expenditure on the basis of these assumptions is expected to be around €19.4 million in 2020.The employers concerned are expected to achieve savings on compensation for temporary incapacity for work of about €169.4 on average per employee in quarantine measures, which is around € 16.9 million for the entire business sector (about 100,000 employees). Exact data on the total savings of employers are not available, because the Social Insurance Agency does not record data on the paid wage compensation or its amount (these data are not relevant for the performance of social insurance).",National government; Company / Companies; Social insurance,Employees in standard employment; Self-employed,National funds,Not available. ,No involvement,No involvement,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2020/63/

The basic conditions for providing the allowance are that: * the employer/self-employed pays to the employee a wage compensation in the amount of 80% of his average earnings; *  the employer/self-employed does not initiate termination of employment by notice or agreement; *  that on 31 December 2019 the company was not in difficulties. The contribution is not intended for self-employed themselves, but is limited to self-employed people who have hired one or more employees. The amount of the allowance for one employee corresponds to the compensation of the employee's salary in the amount of 80% of his average earnings, up to a maximum of €1,100. Self-employed will receive the contribution to pay the salaries of their employees.The contribution is provided from 13 March 2020, until the end of the calendar month in which the restrictive measures taken by the Public Health Office of the Slovak Republic will be revoked.","The amount of funding will depend on the capacity provided by the European Social Fund or the state budget, or other sources.

Indeed, as a consequence of the restrictions and the social distancing measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, jobseekers are increasingly at risk of not finding a job for a longer period of time. Therefore, the Parliament decided that during the pandemic unemployment benefit should be paid for a longer period.","During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the unemployment benefit period has been extended by one month (up to a maximum of seven months) for those who could not find a job. The measure is finalized to sustain people that remained unemployed up to the end of the original unemployment benefit period.

During this period of quarantine, one parent must remain with the children. So far, the nursing benefit has been paid only for 10 calendar days. The Act. 63/2020 Coll. extends the period of payment of this benefit to the whole period of closure of a school or pre-school facility.","According to this COVID-19 related measure, the entitlement to the nursing benefit arises from the first day of the need for personal and full-time treatment of a close person and only expires on the day the need for his/her personal and full-day treatment ends (and not as previously, for a maximum of ten days). The condition of receiving the nursing benefit is that the beneficiary treats a child under 16 years of age all day, whose health condition, as confirmed by the relevant doctor, necessarily requires treatment by another natural person. The benefit is also paid if the beneficiary cares for the child until the age of eleven (up to 18 years of age with long-term adverse health conditions), when the child has been ordered to quarantine or isolate.The benefit shall also be paid if the pre-school or social care facility in which the child is being provided, or the school the child attends, has been closed by decision of the competent authorities or has been subject to a quarantine measure. Another case of eligibility arises when the insured person cares for a close relative, sibling, spouse, spouse or parent of the spouse if the social service facility in which such a person is provided with social services in an outpatient or residential form is as a result of a decision by the competent authorities concluded or quarantined.The first estimations suggest that the nursing benefit for workers will correspond to an average daily amount of €15.80.","It is foreseen that in 2020, the nursing benefit will be paid to 200,000 beneficiaries with a total duration of 101 days. The nursing benefit will be granted for all days during the closure of school and pre-school facilities, not only for 10 calendar days. Expenditure on the basis of these assumptions is expected to be around €319.2 million in 2020.In April and May 2020, the Social Insurance Agency paid 230,262 benefits of ""pandemic nursing"" in the amount of €62,218,391 (a year ago in 2019 it was only 29,608 benefits in the amount of €3,259,123).The pandemic nursing benefit was drawn from April to August 2020, mostly in May and June.

The number of recipients and expenses will decrease in the future as schools and preschools start operating again from 2 September 2020. So there will be no reason to stay home with children due to pandemic quarantine. The declining trend continued until October, when 15,834 benefits were paid. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, nursing expenses have increased by more than eleven times by €132.5 million compared to the previous year.In November 2020, the number of benefit recipients increased slightly to 7,197 compared with November 2019, in December 2020 it was 5,877 more than in December 2019 and in January 2021 7,313 more than in January 2020.

These measures had, hence, a wide impact on some employers, that were totally or partially prevented from work.As a partial relief, in order to diminish temporarily the labour-related expenditures (compulsory payments to the social insurance) of those employers, the government adopted the measure by Section 293ew of the amended Act on social insurance.","The measures entailed the introduction of some amendments to the Social insurance act, postponing the deadline for compulsory payments of employers and self-employed to social security funds. According to this framework, any employer and self-employed paying compulsory contributions to health and pension insurance funds, and whose revenue from business decreased by at least 40%, are entitled to pay these contributions within 31 July 2020, rather than in March 2020.

The measure aims at protecting jobs and maintaining labour contracts in companies by supporting two-thirds of workers’ wages. This measure adds the following main provisions: it forbids the companies that are entitled to the support to eliminate jobs (collective and individual redundancies); and establishes that the state budget will cover the financing of the part of wages provided by social security.","Decree-Law No. 10-G/2020 of 26 March 2020 establishes that companies in a crisis situation as a result of: i) a complete halt in the activity or ii) or abrupt and sharp decrease of activity of at least 40% of invoicing have access to extraordinary support to help pay the wages of their workers for a maximum period of six months. The criteria related with abrupt reduction in activity of at least 40% concerns the period of one month before the date of the application, with reference to the average of the two previous months, or to the average of the same period in the previous year. For those companies that started their activity less than 12 months, the reference is the average of that whole period. The measure aims at protecting jobs and maintaining labour contracts in companies by supporting two-thirds of workers’ wages.

Workers compensation cannot in any case be below the mandatory minimum wage.The Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 41/2020, of 6 June, that approved the Economic and Social Stabilization Program, extends the extraordinary support for the maintenance of employment contracts and establishes a transitional regime replacing the regime in force of ‘simplified layoff’ by a support to progressive recovery (2.2.). Companies that remain closed as determined by the government continue to benefit from the simplified lay-off regime; the simplified lay-off, in the model currently in force, is extended until the end of July; companies that have a decrease in revenue equal to or greater than 40% may benefit, between August and December 2020, from a support mechanism for progressive recovery; companies that have benefited from the simplified lay-off regime can now benefit from an extraordinary incentive to normalize business activity, choosing one of two modalities: One minimum wage (€635) one-off or two minimum wages over six months. The support for progressive recovery (2.2.1) introduces changes concerning the wages of workers under layoff (at the present a payment by 66%): workers will receive between 77% and 83% of their wages from August to September, and between 88% and 92% from October to December 2020. The measure has two conditions: prohibition of dismissals during the application of the measure and in the subsequent 60 days; and prohibition of the distribution of dividends during the application of the measure.The Resolution introduces also a one-off measure, the Stabilization Complement with the aim to improve the income of workers under layoff (2.3). The one-off measure, payable in July, in the amount of income loss of one month of lay-off, which can vary between €100 and €351 applies to all workers with an income, in February, up to two minimum wages and who have registered a loss of basic salary, and were in layoff in one of the months between April and June.

For this purpose, the state provides additional funds to Kredex (a state founded foundation) and Rural Development Fund to provide support measures to companies in a form of loans and loan guarantees. On a smaller scale, those measures are already available and relevant instructions for the applicants and terms and conditions of the measures have been approved by the Kredex at the end of March 2020, but additional government finances are needed for the full provision of these measures. For this, the supplementary state budget was approved by the Parliament on 15 April 2020.","**Kredex, the Credit and Export Guarantee Fund** (state founded foundation), provides loans and loan guarantees to companies. To relieve the impacts of the COVID-19, KredEx offers additional loan guarantees and loans:1. emergency loan guarantee for issuing new loans and to relax the repayment schedules of existing bank loans,2. emergency loan for companies who have been turned down by banks.The guarantee enables a company to secure the obligations of an enterprise, arising from loan, leasing and guarantee contracts.Requirements to be eligible:* According to the financial projections presented, the company is sustainable and solvent in the long term.* The company was not in difficulty as of 31 December 2019.* The company has no overdue debts which have incurred before 1st January 2020.* No bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings have been initiated against the company.General conditions:* The sum of outstanding amounts of loans or loan guarantee of Kredex cannot exceed €5 million per company. * The total amount of emergency loans from Kredex and loans with emergency guarantee by Kredex cannot exceed double the salary cost of the company for 2019 with social tax. Exceptions are available: the maximum guaranteed obligation could be up to 25% of thecompany's turnover in 2019 or to a justified 18-month liquidity requirement for a SME or to a justified 12-month liquidity requirement for a large company).Specific conditions by type:* New loans, guarantee: Up to 90% of the guaranteed loan or lease (60% in case of a construction or retail/wholesale trade sector company)* Existing loans, fixed guarantee: Up to 35% of the loan and lease to be secured, but no more than the sum of the payments of the principal amount of the loan or lease which will remain accessible to the company until 31 December 2021. * Existing loans, proportional guarantee: Up to 50% of the loan and lease to be secured.* Extraordinary loan by Kredex: the amount is up to €5 million. The interest rate is from 4% per annum in case the loan is at least 50% collateralised, and 6% per annum in case of only owner-guaranteed loan.The validity period of the guarantee is 72 months; the loan period is 6-72 months. The guarantee can be issued and amended until 31 December 2020.For agriculture, fishing and food industry companies, similar measures are provided by the **Rural Development Fund**. The total amount of the funding is €200 million.The maximum loan amount for single-applicants is up to €1 million, if the loan is taken together with a credit or financing institution, the maximum amount is €2 million. The interest rate is from 2% and fixed for 2 months. The loan period is up to six years, in case of investment loans -  ten years. At least 30% of the loan must be guaranteed (e.g. real estate, surety or other). Loan applications are accepted until 23 December 2020.In case of loan guarantee, similar to Kredex measure, the total amount of the loan to be guaranteed cannot exceed double the salary cost of the company for 2019 with social tax,   25% of the company's turnover in 2019 or  a justified 18-month liquidity requirement for an SME or a justified 12-month liquidity requirement for a large company. Up to €5 million is guaranteed, but not more than 90% of a proportionally guaranteed loan or 35% of a fixed guaranteed loan. The length of the guarantee is up to six years.","Kredex: data available [here](https://www.eas.ee/covid-19-moju-eesti-majandusele/)By 8 July 2021, 610 applications have been filed, of which 485 have received a positive decision in the total amount of loans of €385.9 million.

Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month.However, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.The Croatian Employment Service unifies two measures: This measure “Support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by COVID-19“ [HR-2020-12/361](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HR-2020-12_361) and ""Support for preservation of jobs by micro-entrepreneurs whose economic activity has been disrupted due to a special circumstance caused by the COVID-19” [HR-2020-27/921](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HR-2020-27_921).","The support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by coronavirus is implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by awarding grants as a form of co-financing of wage costs. The Croatian Employment Service (CES) awards grants to an eligible employer in the amount of HRK 3,250 (€434) per month for full-time worker and HRK 1.625,00 (€217) per month for part-time worker. CES also awards a proportional part of the amount of HRK 3,250 or HRK 1,625 per worker for the time they did not work according to the decision of the Civil Protection Directorate.The support can be provided to* employers in the following activities: providing accommodation and preparation and serving of food and drinks (Sector I), transportation and storage (Sector H) and health tourism; labour-intensive activities within the manufacturing industry like textiles, clothing, footwear, leather, wood and furniture; * employers who have been banned from performing their business activities by decisions of the Civil Protection Headquarters (national, county, local self-government units) and cannot carry out their activities, and * all other employers who can prove the adverse impact of special circumstances, if their income is reduced by more than 20%. Since 26 March 2020 all beneficiaries of grants for self-employment (owners and employees), employers who have been registered at the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute by 29 February 2020 and all workers employed until 29 February 2020 have also been included.The support cannot be granted if there has been a decrease in the number of employees in the period from 20 March 2020 until the date of submission of the Grant Application, if the percentage of dismissal is greater than:* 40% for employers employing up to 10 workers;* 20% for small businesses;* 15%for medium-sized enterprises and * 10% for large companies.The aforementioned amount of the grant - HRK 3,250 or HRK 1,625 per worker - is applied for March 2020, while for April and May 2020 it will be increased per worker monthly to HRK 4,000 (€534) for full-time job or HRK 2,625 (€267) for part-time job. The state will also cover also payment of social contributions, which amounts to HRK 1,460 (€194) for a net wage of HRK 4,000. In total, the state will pay HRK 5,460 (€728) per employee.","At the end of March, around 65,000 employers with around 400,000 thousand workers were registered as users of the scheme at the CES.  At the end of April, the government has paid more than one and a half billion HRK (€200 million) to preserve jobs for around 485,000 employees. Almost 84,000 employers have received support, including 145 large entrepreneurs.The main criterion for assistance was a 20% drop in turnover. Leading recipients of the grants are big touristic company Valamar Riviera with more than 2,500 employees who have been paid more than eight million HRK (€1.07 million) followed by Boxmark Leather with more than 2,000 employees, Mlinar with 1,737 employees, a car parts manufacturer from Solin AD Plastik with more than 1,500 employees. Of all beneficiaries of the grant 91,78% are micro firms with less than 10 employees, 6,99% are SME with less than 50 employees, 1.06% are medium employers with less than 250 employees, 0.03% are bigger employers with more than 250 employees.According to the data of the Ministry of Labour and Pension System issued in May, the measures included about 550,000 employees. According to the same source, in March and April 2020 alone, the state allocated a total of around HRK 3.5 billion (€467 million) to measures to preserve jobs in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It is estimated that the measures in May 2020 costed the state treasury about HRK two billion (€267 million). Therefore, the state has spent around HRK 5.5 billion (€734 million) in three months of implementing measures to preserve employment in the coronary crisis.",National government; Public employment service,Employees in standard employment; Sector specific set of companies,National funds,Trade Unions demanded that the recipients of the aid should be publicly disclosed because they fear that abuse of the obtained funds is quite possible.

The length of debt moratorium (three or six month period) depends on the borrower.However, before this act was approved, many banks have introduced their own conditions under which the borrower can ask for the postponement of repayments. Now, the new law unifies these conditions.","Eligible are all borrowers who were negatively affected by coronavirus pandemic. Applicants have to ask for the payment postponement at the bank and declare that their situation is caused by anti-virus measures (unemployment, quarantine, decrease in business activity). Then both interest and principal payments would be interrupted. The act applies to loans taken out before 26 March 2020. The debt moratorium does not apply to credit cards, overdrafts, revolving loans, operating leases or loans related to capital market transactions. Repayments cannot be deferred for loans where the debtor has been late in repayment for over 30 days as of 26 March 2020. The postponements also do not involve any fees and will not cause a negative entry in the bank register for the client, leading to a bad credit rating.During the deferment period, individual borrowers will be fully relieved of debt service obligations whereas corporate borrowers will continue to pay interest and fees but enjoy a holiday on scheduled principal instalments for the duration of the deferment. Although borrowers are able to defer their repayments and thus extend the repayment period by the time of deferral without any increase in the amount of repayments, interest continues to be charged during to the deferral period, thus resulting in the borrower paying a higher overall amount of interest.","According to [Czech National Bank (Česká národní banka, ČNB)] (http://www.cnb.cz), as of 16 October 2020, the number of:* approved deferred household loans according to Act 177/2020 Coll. was 212,887 with the total amount of CZK 162,690,000,000 (€5,960,432,313 approx.).

However, in Croatia it is difficult to evaluate if subsidies and transfers have achieved these objectives. State subsidies in Croatia are relatively high. They have been concentrated in a few sectors, with a high proportion of them going to the national railway company Hrvatske željeznice ((HŽ) and to the agriculture sector. Due to the EU requirement and membership, Croatia has improved policies related to state subsidies and lowered their level. ","Amendments to the Act on Personal Income Tax and Amendments to the Act on the Company Income Tax (OG 32/20) introduced novelties regarding the impact of grants on the income tax base and tax liability for entrepreneurs which received grants intended to mitigate the adverse effects of special circumstances. Income tax payers record grants into realized income, but exclude it from the tax base when determining the income tax liability. According to the amended Act on Company Income Tax, grants obtained due to special circumstances do not affect the threshold for compulsory shift from personal income tax to company income tax. This threshold is HRK 7.5 million (€ 1 million) of revenue. Furthermore, grants obtained do not affect the threshold of realized annual revenues according to which the tax rate of 12% and 18% is determined (the threshold is HRK 7.5 million (€ 1 million) of revenue.It is hard to predict the role of this measure and the number of possible users but from the public discussions it can be assessed that it would be relatively limited.

The measure alleviates pressure on the institutions that are tasked with organizing and distributing unemployment benefits, both the National Employment Office (NEO) and the trade unions (that also play an important role in paying out the unemployment benefits). The use of temporary unemployment means that the employers no longer have to pay the wages of their employees (the cost is transferred to the government through the unemployment benefit), thereby enabling them to reduce their costs and enhances their ability to better cope with the period of inactivity of the business.The measures makes the procedure shorter and more simplified for employees in order to make sure that they receive their unemployment benefit as fast as possible.","From 13 March 2020, the notion of temporary unemployment due to force majeure will be flexibly applied by the NEO. All situations of temporary unemployment due to the corona virus can be considered as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even if, for example, it is still possible to work on certain days.For the duration of the restrictive measures, the employer is no longer obliged to send notices of temporary unemployment for reasons of force majeure to the competent unemployment office of the NEO. The employee may use a simplified form to submit the application for benefits to the designated payment institution.The employee receives a benefit equal to 70% of his average capped salary (capped at €2,754.76 per month). The employee who is made temporarily unemployed due to force majeure (reason ""coronavirus"") will receive a supplement of €5.63 per day on top of the unemployment benefit, from the NEO. A withholding tax on professional income of 26.75% is deducted from the benefit. ","At the peak of the crisis, approximately 1.2 million employees made use of the system of temporary unemployment out of an active population of less than 4 million.In 2020, the COVID-19 crisis caused a particularly sharp increase in the uptake of temporary unemployment.

Many of these companies that abuse this situation are in fact even still functioning properly despite the Corona measures. The social partners argue that easy access to temporary unemployment is an absolute necessity.

On March 31, the government supported the proposal of the Ministry of Culture and expanded the normative regulation also to self-employed and the micro-entrepreneurs.  The allowance for idle time measure in general is described in Section 14 of the law 'On Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Threat to the State and Its Consequences Due to the Spread of COVID-19' (adopted on 20 March 2020, valid from 22 March 2020).Specifically regarding the self-employed, the government has adopted the Regulations of Cabinet of Ministers No. 179, 'Regulations regarding the Allowance for Idle Time for self-employed who are affected by spread of COVID-19' (Adopted on 31 March 2020).","The eligible self-employed are individuals registered in the State Revenue Service as involved in economic activity, that have paid social contributions as self-employed, or as receiver of author’s fee, or have paid micro-enterprise tax, or have paid taxes as individual merchants, and have not got income during the idle period, except some permanent authors’ fees.The allowance is calculated using the State Revenue Service data that is provided in the declarations of self-employed, according to the following criteria:* For those who pay micro-enterprise tax, 50% of average monthly income from the economic activity as micro-entrepreneur (reference period is last two full quarters).* Self-employed person in general tax regime – 75% of the average income (the reference period is the two last full quarters, income is calculated in accordance with the state mandatory social insurance contribution of a person).* For a person from both above mentioned categories who within the idle time has returned to work after child care leave – 100% of granted parents benefit (the reference period is of six months before declaring the state of emergency).For neither of categories the allowance can be more than €700.The regulations define 17 reasons when the allowance can be rejected. ","For the period from 12 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 the State Revenue Service (SRS) has paid idle-time allowances to 2,388 self-employed persons. Among self-employed persons, the largest number of idle-time benefits has been granted to the following sectors: 16% arts, entertainment and recreation; 9.8% professional, scientific and technical services and 9% education. For 11.9% of the recipients of benefits, the type of main activity is not indicated, but for another 21.2% the type of main activity is 'Other services'.From 25 March 2020 to 30 July 2020 4,176 self-employed have submitted 9,658 applications. 62% of applications were refused because the declared amount of the state mandatory social contributions were less than €20 per month, 13% were refused because the income from the part time work were more than the state average monthly wage, 11% because a self-employed was employed full time with other employer, 6% because he or she was employed in the state of local government institutions, and 3% because she or he is employer in meaning of the Labour law. 6,610 applications submitted by 2,396 self-employed were approved. Of all self-employed who were granted idle time allowance 17.2% received one allowance, 22.4% - two allowances, 28,9% - three allowances and 31.5% - four and more allowances.

These measures mainly concern: flexibilization of the working time, working from home, teleworking.Soon after this, on the 16 March 2020, the Romanian President has declared a state of emergency – as a result, schools  remained closed until Orthodox Easter (19 April) initially. After 30 days, the state of emergency was prolonged with another 30 days, till 15 May 2020 - during all this period, the schools remain suspended. This situation left a lot of employees without any immediate solutions to ensure their children supervision and care. To  respond to this problem, the Romanian Parliament passed a law (Law no. 19/2020) requiring employers (both in the public and the private sector) to grant paid leave to one of the parents if schools are closed due to “extreme situations”. ","According to the law 19/2020 , employers must grant employees paid leave if schools are closed in exceptional circumstances, but only if the tasks associated with the employees’ roles cannot be performed in “working from home” or teleworking conditions. Paid leave can be granted to only one of the parents, and only if the child in care is of maximum 12 years of age (or 18 years of age for children with a disability), who are formally registered as attending courses in a school. In some sectors, the parent's request for leave is conditioned by the employer's acceptance (national energy system units, operating units in the nuclear sectors, continuous fire units, health and social care units, telecommunications, public radio and television, rail transport, units that ensure the public transport and sanitation of the localities, as well as the supply of the population with gas, electricity, heat, and water). During such leave, employees will be entitled to a payment of up to 75% of the employee’s base salary, but not more than 75% of the average gross salary in the economy. The allowance is subject to personal income tax and social security contributions (i.e. personal income tax, social security contribution, health insurance contribution and work insurance contribution). The net value of the allowance paid by the employer (the amount actually received by the parent) can be recovered from the Guarantee Fund for the payment of salary claims; the corresponding personal income tax and the social security contributions are borne by the employer. To recover the net allowance, employers should submit a request to the local or the Bucharest unemployment agency. ",These applies to all employees with children in care.

SI-2020-11/436,Temporary layoff scheme and reimbursement of related wage compensation to employers,Povračilo izplačanih nadomestil plač,Slovenia,Applies nationwide,03/13/2020,06/30/2021,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,New aspects included into existing measure,Employment protection and retention,Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work),04/10/2020,"This measure, introduced in the framework of the 'Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act (ZIUZEOP)', in force since 11 April 2020, aims at the protection and retention of jobs. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government adopted a ‘temporary lay-off scheme’ and reimbursement of wage compensations to workers who cannot work due to force majeure. The measure addresses laid-off workers for whom company temporary fails to provide work and workers who cannot work due to force majeure:* workers in quarantine, who cannot work from home; * workers who look after children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; * workers who cannot come to work on the grounds of the suspension of public transport or ban on the border crossing.","According to the Employment Relationship Act, when a company temporarily fails to provide work for business reasons (in the event of a temporary layoff), the worker is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of 80% of the wage basis. The wage basis is determined at the worker’s average monthly wage for full-time work during the past three months. On the other hand, if a worker cannot carry out his work due to force majeure, he is entitled to half of the payment he would have received if he was working, but not less than 70% of the minimum wage. The temporary laid-off worker is obliged to respond to the employer’s invitation in a manner and under the conditions laid down in the lay-off letter (Employment Relationship Act, Articles 137, 138).The measure being examined, attempting to cushion the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, grants the employers with 80% reimbursement of the sums payed to provide the economic treatment mentioned above to workers (in case of temporary lay-off as well as force majeure). This reimbursement is funded with the state budget. Reimbursement is limited to the average monthly salary in 2019 and cannot be lower than the minimum wage (it is thus higher than statutory determined compensations).The maximum length of receiving compensation is from 13 March to 31 May. To be eligible for the reimbursements, a company had to demonstrate a 20% lower income in the first half of 2020 and 50% lower income in the second half of 2020, compared to 2019.","Companies that are not eligible are:* State institutions.* Financial and insurance companies with more than 10 employees. * Companies having outstanding debt with the Financial Administration.* Foreign or international organisations (not including humanitarian and disability organisations).The Employment Service of Slovenia administers employers’ requests for compensations. Up to 31 May, the Employment Service received requests for wage compensation for 275,317 employees and additional 54,168 since 1 June.According to the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities data, employers submitted 46,009 applications for wage reimbursement of 275,317 employees under the first and second emergency laws (adopted in the period from 13 March to 31 May 2020). Under the third emergency law (adopted in June 2020), employers submitted 10,930 applications for 64,667 employees. Under the fourth emergency law, there were 6,787 applications for almost 24,200 employees by 20 July 2020. Until September 2020, the government paid off €281 million to employers for temporary layoff scheme.Unlike the short-time scheme, the temporary layoff scheme this was very well accepted by employers who demanded the prolongation of this measure. It is commonly believed that registered unemployment would be much higher without the temporary layoff scheme. The registered unemployment was 9.2 per cent in July 2020, while it was 7.4% at the same time in 2019 (source: Employment Service of Slovenia).The temporary layoff scheme expired at the end of June 2021. Employment Service of Slovenia paid €539 million for the temporary layoff scheme and reimbursement of related wage until 27 May 2021. In that period, 31,600 employers received reimbursements for 214,225 employees. The minister of labour expects a slight rise in unemployment after the expiry of the measure. Employment trend shows the positive impact of emergency measures. Apart from the peak unemployment rates in May 2020 and February 2021, the unemployment trend moved normally. In April 2021, the unemployment rate dropped back to its pre-epidemic level. It is important to note that reimbursement of wages for workers not working due to force majeur has remained in force.",National government; Social insurance,,European Funds; National funds,"Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted many proposals to the law, mainly for clarifying the definitions. In first reactions, employers protested against the rule requesting 20% lower incomes. They said that it would exclude many companies from the support mechanism (Mekina, 2020). The government agreed to employer organisations and lowered the threshold to 10% in the second COVID-19 law ZIUZEOP-A, issued on 30 April 2020. They argued that state support shouldn’t stimulate companies to work less. Trade unions demanded a fixed period of six months after the epidemic in which employers shouldn’t lay off workers for business reasons. Some proposals were accepted but not these two. The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. It was blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council.While employer organisations achieved a lower threshold (reduction of company income by 10% compared to the pre-crisis level in the second COVID-19 law ZIUZEOP-A, issued on 30 April 2020), trade unions were less successful. They demanded a temporary ban (of three months after the epidemics) on dismissals of workers for whom companies receive reimbursement of wage compensation. The legislator has not agreed to their proposal, so emergency laws do not determine temporary employment security and workers can be dismissed when state subsidies expire.",Other,Consulted,No,Only private sector,,No,,,http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO819; http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO818; https://www.gov.si/assets/organi-v-sestavi/FURS/Novice-2020/Preglednica-ukrepov-v-zvezi-z-delom-in-placevanjem-prispevkov-za-socialno-varnost-za-vase-zaposlene.pd; https://www.mladina.si/197558/pravljica-o-mega-protikoronskem-paketu/; https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-1195?sop=2020-01-119; https://www.rtvslo.si/gospodarstvo/za-subvencioniranje-skrajsanega-delovnika-prijavljenih-ze-20-500-zaposlenih/52766; https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-0901?sop=2020-01-090; https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-1831?sop=2020-01-183; https://www.delo.si/gospodarstvo/novice/vlada-je-podaljsala-ukrep-cakanja-na-delo-344157.htm; file:///C:/Users/Maja/AppData/Local/Temp/zds.si-ZZUOOP-15.10.2020.pd; https://www.iusinfo.si/Priloge/PRIPDZ/PRIPDZ101E1472VIIIN40_6_1.PD; http://pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO830; http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO832; https://www.iusinfo.si/Priloge/PRIPDZ/PRIPDZ101E1963VIIIN19_6_1.PD; https://www.rtvslo.si/gospodarstvo/cigler-kralj-po-zakljucku-ukrepa-cakanja-na-delo-pricakujemo-rahel-porast-brezposelnosti/58198

Deferred payment must be paid in two years, until 31 March 2022, in one installment with no interest charge. It is an automatically recognized right meaning that there is no need to submit any claim for obtaining this right. Eligible are self-employed persons (including farmers) who do not employ other workers.The  first and second COVID-19 laws (ZIUZEOP and ZIUZEOP-A) have introduced the right of self-employed persons to be fully exempt from paying social security contributions. Eligible persons are self-employed, clerics, associates, and farmers who cannot carry out their work. They have to make a request to Financial Administration in which they prove 10% lower income in 2020 compared to 2019 or, in cases of recently established businesses, 10% lower average monthly income compared to the pre-crisis level. Later on, beneficiaries will have to pay social security contributions if their revenue exceeds 90% of the revenue in the pre-crisis period. Tee Financial administration manages the requests for exemption from paying social security contributions. Postponed and annulled payments of social security contributions are limited to the period between 13 March and 31 May 2020. After 31 May no new claims will be accepted. In addition to these two measures, self-employed may also claim for deferred payment of income tax.","While the COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP, issued on 10 April 2020) was in parliamentary procedure, non-governmental organizations protested against discriminatory “referential period” for self-employed persons. While referential period for companies was one year, it was one month (February) for self-employed. The argument was that this rule exclude many self-employed persons, as they typically receive their fees irregularly and many may have had no money inflows in February. Their proposal was not integrated into the first COVID-19 law, issued on 10 April 2020.Two cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stressed that the emergency measure left out the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed (Šučur, 2020).The second COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP-A from 30 April 2020) finally adopted their proposals: it extended the referential period as well as the group of eligible persons (besides full-time also part-time self-employed).",National government; Social insurance,Self-employed,National funds,Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted proposals to the law but no one linked to this measure.,Other,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO819; http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO818; https://www.gov.si/novice/2020-04-03-ukrepi-na-davcnem-podrocju-za-blazitev-posledic-koronavirusa-za-samozaposlene; https://www.dnevnik.si/1042926927/Kultura/pomoc-samozaposlenim-v-kulturi-na-cigavi-strani-je-ministrstv; https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-0901?sop=2020-01-090

Those ones concerned are eligible if they prove that their income declined during the crisis and if they have no outstanding debt with the Financial Administration.","Monthly basic income is determined at €350 for March and €700 for April and May 2020. Eligible persons have to make a request to the Financial Administration, in which they declare that their income decreased at least of 10% in 2020 with respect to 2019, or a 10% lower average monthly revenue compared to pre-crisis period. Later on, beneficiaries will have to return the support received, if in 2020 their income exceeds 90% of their revenue in 2019. The financial administration is appointed to manage claims for basic income. The measure addresses self-employed, clerics and farmers who have no other insurance deriving from other types of employment. The measure is limited to the period between 13 March and 31 May 2020. After 31 May no new claims are possible.","While the first COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP, issued on 10 April 2020) was in parliamentary procedure, non-governmental organisations protested against discriminatory “referential period” for self-employed persons. While referential period for companies was one year, it was one month (February) for self-employed. NGOs said that this rule exclude many self-employed persons, since they receive their fees irregularly and many may have had no money inflows in February. Their proposal was not integrated into the first COVID-19 law, issued on 10 April 2020. Two cultural organisations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organised on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the income and for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stressed that the emergency measure left out the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed (Šučur, 2020).The second COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP-A from 30 April 2020) adopted their proposals: it extended the referential period as well as the group of eligible persons (besides full-time also part-time self-employed).Financial administration paid off the last instalment of basic income in June 2020. In April 2020, 32.000 self-employed received €11.2 million. In May 2020, €27.5 million was given to 37,500 recipients and another €2.2 million to 4,753 part-time self-employed. In the last payment (June 2020), 45,424 self-employed received €39,8 million. In total, about 51,000 self-employed persons benefited from the measure receiving more than €80 million during the epidemic.

The legal reference of this measure is Article 43, paragraph 1, of the Law Decree No. 18 of 2020.","The joint protocol aims to ensure the protection of workers' health and the necessary safety conditions in all workplaces. In particular, the agreement provides that the continuation of production activities can take place only on condition that adequate levels of protection are guaranteed to workers. To facilitate the containment of the virus, the agreement allows to suspend or temporary reduce the activity, or to adopt the telework (smart working) scheme as much as possible. The agreement also indicates specific containment measures that follow anti-contagion safety protocols (interpersonal distance between workers or adoption of safety devices). Among these measures are:1. The use of smart and remote working schemes for the activities that can be carried out at home or remotely. 2. Encouraging the use of paid leave also through collective agreements. 3. The suspension of the activities of company departments not indispensable for production. 4. The adoption of anti-contagion safety protocols, the respect of the interpersonal distance of one meter as main measure of containment, the adoption of individual protection tools (e.g. masks and hand sanitizers). 5. The sanitisation of workplaces and common areas. 6. Limiting to the minimum essential the movement of people inside production sites. 7. Encouraging the negotiation of specific collective agreements for the companies that are still in production. 8. The establishment of a company committee with the participation of employees' workplace representatives for monitoring the application of the protocol. The protocol was renegotiated and revised on 24 April 2020 and attached to the Decree of the Prime Ministry of 26 April 2020. The main amendments concerned the following issues: * The non-application of the Protocol - which results in the inability to guarantee adequate levels of protection - determines the suspension of the activity until conditions of safety are restored.* The supervision of the client company about the compliance with the provisions also with regard to the staff of third-party companies operating in the client's premises/construction sites.* Attention to the means of transport to reach the workplace.Furthermore, the €50 million allocated by the Government to undertakings to implement the agreement will be distributed, upon request, by the National Agency for inward investment promotion and enterprise development (INVITALIA).

Restaurants providing or delivering takeaway meals are also covered.* If the government has not obliged the self-employed to interrupt their activity partially or completely, but the self-employed is forced to interrupt their activity for a period of at least 7 consecutive calendar days as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, for example for self-isolation, a lack of raw materials or for various reasons of economic or organisational nature (linked to COVID-19), then they are also eligible for the bridging right.This includes self-employed exercising a care profession such as physiotherapists, dentists and medical specialists.","Certain conditions apply in order to be able to benefit from the bridging right: * The person has to be self-employed as main profession (including helpers, assisting spouses in the maxi-status and (primo-starters), or self-employed as secondary profession with provisional social security contributions that are at least equal to the minimum contributions for self-employed persons in their main profession;* The person has to be self-employed and pay social security contributions in Belgium;* The person must not receive a replacement income.The Corona bridging right amounts to (for March, April, May and June):* €1,291.69 without family responsibilities;* €1,614.10 with family responsibilities.If granted, the bridging right for March will be paid at the beginning of April and for April, at the beginning of May.",It is unclear how many people are eligible and will make use of the support.,National government,Self-employed; Solo-self-employed; One person or microenterprises,National funds,There have been some issues with the bridging right with retailers that are open for business but have been required to work on an appointment basis.

Foreign workers or seasonal workers employed in Austria are no longer allowed to enter the country, resulting in a shortage of labour both on farms and in food processing companies (e.g. meat sector). In order to ensure and maintain the food supply, all the work that is now necessary must be carried out on time. The Chambers of Agriculture, together with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and the machinery ring, are endeavouring to support farmers and processing enterprises in carrying out the necessary work on schedule despite the current situation and thus to continue to ensure the supply of domestic food. ","Farmers can register their demand for urgently needed labour via an online platform; interested workers can register likewise. They are paid according to collective agreements, but also voluntary (i.e. unpaid) work is possible. Also persons on short-time work in their regular job may apply (they are allowed to have additional earnings with no upper limit). Students of certain relevant schools or university programmes can have this work credited as internships. Placement is made according to the urgency of the work to be carried out in the companies, including seasonal work. In order to be able to find the right workers for the companies, general conditions such as the type of work, the amount of work and time frame, as well as the required duration of the work on the company etc. are checked and compared with the data of the interested helpers.","Initially, the offer has exceeded the demand by far, but farmers are not entirely content with this initiative. Farmers have called attention to the fact that they would prefer their regular seasonal workers due to their experience (in Upper Austria, it was spoken of preferably 80% foreign seasonal workers (mostly from Romania, Albania and the Ukraine) and 20% domestic workers).

FR-2020-10/462,Short-time working,Chômage partiel,France,Applies nationwide,03/01/2020,12/31/2020,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,New aspects included into existing measure,Employment protection and retention,Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work),04/10/2020,"Link to case [FR-2020-10/217](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/FR-2020-10_217)The short-time working (activité partielle /partial activity or chômage partiel /partial unemployment) is a tool at the service of the public policy of prevention of economic layoffs, which allows the employer in difficulty to have all or part of the cost of the remuneration of his employees covered.This system is an old one and is in general reactivated in times of crisis, as happened also in 2008. It is governed by Articles L. 5122-1 et seq. and R. 5122-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code. In the context of the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the system was relaxed. The partial activity is intended for all employees who suffer a reduction in remuneration attributable to: * either a reduction in the working hours implemented in the establishment or part of the establishment below the legal working hours (35 hours);* a temporary closure of all or part of the establishment.Requests for partial activity are made by employers if the drop in activity is caused by one of the reasons referred to in Article R. 5122-1 of the Labour Code, including circumstances of an exceptional nature, which apply in the present crisis.During the period of partial activity: * The employer receives from the public authorities (Services and Payment Agency - ASP) an allowance equivalent to a share of the hourly pay of the employee placed in partial activity;* The employee receives a partial activity allowance from the employer in lieu of salary for the period during which the employee is placed in partial activity.","The short-time working scheme covers all employees of the private sector. With the new provisions adopted to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the partial activity allowance paid by the State to the company - co-financed by the State and by the joint body that manages the unemployment insurance scheme (Unédic) - is no longer a lump sum, but is proportional to the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity.The 'remainder payable' by the employer, i.e. the amount of the remuneration which the employer must pay to the employee, is zero for all employees whose remuneration is less than 4.5 gross SMIC (€45.68 per hour or €6,927.39 per month).The compensation due to the employee covers at least 70% of his previous gross remuneration, i.e. approximately 84% of the net salary.There is nothing to prevent an employer from compensating its employees in excess of 70% of gross salary if it can/wishes to do so or if a collective or company-level agreement so provides.In all cases, a minimum of €8.03 per hour is respected.Specific measures are planned for employees of private employers (cleaning ladies) and childcare assistants (who look after young children) who are usually paid by the hour with a job voucher system.Update: The short-time working scheme has been progressively adapted to the health and economic situation. The main changes are the following:* An Ordinance of 24 June provides that the rate of partial activity allowances will be set by decree and may be increased for sectors particularly affected by the health crisis. These new rates will be applicable as of 1 June 2020 and until a date that the decree is expected to set at 30 September 2020. The increased rate applies in sectors relating to tourism, hotels, restaurants, sports, culture, air transport and events. Sectors whose activity depends on the above and which are experiencing a very sharp drop in turnover will also benefit. The same will apply to employers whose main activity involves receiving the public and is interrupted due to the epidemic. A decree allows for basic coverage of 85% of the compensation paid and an increased coverage covering these compensation payments in full. * The terms and conditions for implementing the partial activity system are secured and simplified by a decree of 26 June 2020. This decree allows companies with at least 50 establishments to submit a single request for partial activity (for several employees). It also confirms that prior consultation of the Social and Economic Committee (CSE) in the event of recourse to the system is only required for companies with at least 50 employees. * Partial activity for childcare without a school certificate. Since June 2, 2020, parents looking after a child under 16 years of age can only maintain or partially activate their childcare activities upon presentation of a certificate from the childcare establishment, according to the Ministry of Labour. It is therefore no longer sufficient for the employee, as has been the case since 1 May, to send his or her employer a certificate on honour that his or her child cannot attend school. The Ministry of Labour specifies that this certificate from the establishment will be likely to be requested in the event of an administrative control.* A new short-time working scheme will start on 1 October 2020 and provides for an obligation to remain in employment for the duration of the partial activity. The scheme will last three months, renewable, and may not exceed six months (maximum duration of the current scheme). The employees concerned will receive 100% of their net salary at the level of the minimum wage (SMIC) at 72% for 1.3 SMIC (compared to 84% since the crisis). For high salaries, a ceiling is set at 60% of 4.5 SMIC. Already reduced on 1 June, the State and Unédic allowance will amount to 60% of the compensation paid to employees, with a floor set at 90% of the minimum wage. As a reminder, the State's contribution was 100% of the allowance until 4.5 SMIC at the end of March, before being reduced to 85% on 1 June.* A second partial activity scheme came into force on 1 July (see [FR-2020-27/1030](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/FR-2020-27_1030). Known as ""long-term"", it concerns companies facing a lasting decline in their activity, such as the aeronautics industry, in order to guarantee a high level of protection. It is for a renewable period of six months and can be mobilised for a maximum of two years, with 100% of the net salary being maintained for employees at the minimum wage and up to 84% for salaries above 1.15 minimum wage, with a ceiling of 70% above 4.5 minimum wage. The State pay 80% of the compensation paid and 85% for agreements signed before 1 October. Its triggering requires a company or branch agreement and validation by the Direccte, and will be based on a diagnosis and forecast of activity and shared employment.","As of April 7, 2020, 692,000 applications for partial activity have been filed. They concern 669,000 establishments and 6,300,000 employees (2.3 million more than on 31 March).  About 59% of employees who have applied for partial activity since 1 March work in establishments with fewer than 50 employees. These establishments account for 34% of private salaried employment. Conversely, those working in establishments with more than 250 employees account for 15% of employees in partial activity, while these establishments account for 20% of private salaried employment.The Ministry of Labour (DARES and DGEFP) and the public employment service Pôle Emploi have decided to update these data every weeks. The last issue of 7 April is available with this link:https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr/dares-etudes-et-statistiques/tableaux-de-bord/marche-du-travail-pendant-le-covid-19/article/situation-sur-le-marche-du-travail-au-7-avril-2020UPDATE. According to DARES and Pôle Emploi, in June 2020, 4.5 million employees were in partial activity (i.e. about a quarter of private sector employees), after 7.9 million in May, 8.8 million in April1 and 7.2 million in March. Among them, in June, around 700,000 employees would have been in partial activity for childcare or because of situations of vulnerability/fragility:https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/dares_tdb_marche-travail_crise-sanitaire_21-07-20__.pdfUPDATEAs of 21 March, 265,000 claims for the month of February have been filed (+60,000 in one week) by 247,000 companies. They concern 1.2 million employees and 102 million hours. For January, 310,000 claims were filed (+20,000 in one week) by 283,000 companies, for 1.6 million employees and 124 million hours.In February 2021, 2.1 million employees would have been effectively in partial activity (i.e. about 11% of private sector employees), after 2.3 million in January.

First, current civil servants are extended, and secondly, former civil servants are recruited voluntarily. (The so-called 'alternative civilian service' is an alternative form of the mandatory national military service (substitute service). The regular length of ordinary alternative civilian service is nine months, with some compensation provided.) In the pre-existing Civil Service Act (§8a/Abs.6), such a case has been provided for (see sources).","The length of civilian service is extended by 3 months for all those for who it would end by the end of March 2020 (until the end of June 2020 i.e. mandatory, by legal notice). Depending on the development of the situation and as required, those who finish their civil service in April or May 2020 may also receive an extension of up to 3 months. It is planned to transfer civilian servicemen who are currently serving or will soon be serving to positions where there is special need (e.g. if a civilian servant would have an assignment for a kindergarten, but this is closed, he will be assigned to another facility instead, e.g. a retirement home). In addition, former civil servants are recruited voluntarily for full-time positions (at least 40 hours per week, overtime can be added) from May or June 2020 for a duration of two to three months.While regular civil servants who have been mandatorily extended receive their regular remuneration (€346.70) plus supplement of  €189.90 (tax free), the newly recruited voluntary former civil servants receive in addition to this a flat-rate compensation of almost €1,300 (gross). ","The extension of the civil service for those for who it would have ended in March applies to around 1,500 persons. On 1 April 2020, around 3,500 newly recruited voluntary former civil servants started their service.",National government,Other groups of workers,National funds,This was a unilateral initiative by the government.,Not applicable,No involvement,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10005603; https://www.zivildienst.gv.at/Corona_Virus/start.aspx; https://www.zivildienst.gv.at/Corona_Virus/verlaengerung.aspx

At first, only Italy was concerned, but border closures (with the mentioned exceptions, see content of the measure) were extended to further neighbouring countries (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia). Seasonal workers (some of which already have employment permits) who are currently not in Austria are exempt from the exceptions and can thus not work in Austria. However, as agriculture is one of the supply-critical sectors in the current COVID-19 crisis, many seasonal workers, for some of whom employment permits have already been issued, are unable to enter Austria due to travel restrictions and cannot start work as planned. ","In order to counteract the impending labour shortage, the permitted duration of employment is extended for those third-country seasonal workers who are already employed in the country and have been granted a permit and are needed for urgent work.

Teleworking is a right provided for in Article L. 1222-9 of the Labour Code, resulting from the Order of 22 September 2017, and must be favoured in phase 3 of the epidemic. An employee can therefore ask his employer to benefit from telework until further notice. The employer may refuse, but reasons must be given for the refusal.","Since the passage to stage 3 of the epidemic, the implementation of telework must be imperative as soon as the workstation allows it. Telework can be implemented when the workstation layout is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity and to guarantee the protection of employees.Article L. 1222-11 of the Labour Code mentions the risk of an epidemic as a possible justification for the use of telework without the employee's agreement. The implementation of telework in this context does not require any particular formalism.In a circular, the ministry of Labour estimate the employee must receive an allowance intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework: 'In the context of the current health crisis – since telework is carried out, in the majority of cases, over the entire actual working time and is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity, to guarantee the protection of employees and for reasons of public health – it should be considered that the employer is obliged to pay his employee a telework allowance, intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework'. Indeed, the employer has an obligation to bear the professional expenses. This obligation is provided for without restriction by the case-law, which is of general application and must cover teleworkers.'However, adds the ministry of Labour, in view of the difficulty of identifying and circumscribing the expenses relating to the professional activity and those relating to personal life, it is in the employer's interest to favour a lump sum which will simplify its management'.If the allowance paid by the employer is a lump sum, it will then be deemed to be used in accordance with its purpose and will be exempt from social security contributions up to an overall limit of €10/month for an employee who teleworks one day per week. This exempt lump-sum allowance increases to €20/month for an employee teleworking two days a week, €30/month for 3 days a week, etc.","In 2017, about 3% of employees were teleworking at least once a week. According to an INSEE economic report published on 26 March 2020, i.e. ten days after the start of confinement, approximately one third of employees are working at their usual place of work, one third are teleworking and the last third are on short-time working. On 15 March, in a press release, the Ministry of Labour estimates that close to 8 million jobs (or more than four out of ten jobs) are compatible with telework in the private sector.",National government; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,No special funding required,"Social partners have welcomed the need to use telework as much as possible. But some employers' organisations were against the obligation to set up an action plan since 18 March 2021. For instance, on 23 March, the CPME (the employers' organisation representing mainl SMEs, denounced the new version of the health protocol in companies, which requires companies in lockdown zones to draw up an ""action plan"" to promote teleworking. 'No doubt one more piece of paperwork will be an effective barrier against the epidemic,' CPME reacted wryly in a statement. The employers' organisation, according to which 'administrative creativity has no limits', adds that 'company directors running a small or medium-sized business will appreciate that, if they are not offered a vaccination date, a new obligation is imposed on them'. With regard to telework, 'a form of lassitude prevails and it is becoming more and more difficult for employers to impose it. Many employees say they suffer from isolation and want to return to the company's premises', the CPME also states.Trade unions agreed to increase the number of employees in telework, but denounce regularly the lack of financial support of employer and stress the difficult working conditions for some employees living is small accomodations.",Not applicable,No involvement,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/actualites/l-actualite-du-ministere/article/coronavirus-questions-reponses-pour-les-entreprises-et-les-salaries#; https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/le-ministere-en-action/coronavirus-covid-19/questions-reponses-par-theme/article/teletravail-en-periode-de-covid-19; https://www.cpme.fr/espace-presse/communiques-de-presse/pour-faire-barrage-a-lepidemie-le-gouvernement-envisage-une-nouvelle-paperasse

The management can abstain from the duty to start the compulsory settlement or bankruptcy until 31 August if the company became insolvent because of the epidemic. When a creditor files for a bankruptcy proceeding over a debtor, the debtor will have 4 months instead of current 2 months for financial restructuring to prevent bankruptcy. Extensions will be applicable to bankruptcy proceedings, filed for by creditors until 31 August 2020. Other changes tackle compensation of unpaid wages from the Guarantee Fund, personal bankruptcy procedures, and enforcement proceedings.","Deferred compulsory settlement or bankruptcy means that management is not obliged to start this procedure during the period of epidemic and the three succeeding months (until 31 August). The management can abstain from the duty if the company becomes insolvent due to the state, ministry or local authority’s ban on production or trade or if company was solvent on 31 December 2020. On the other hand, the law reinforces some workers’ rights. Workers can have easier access to reimbursements of the Public Scholarship, Development, Disability and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (Guarantee Fund) for unpaid wages in the last three months, unpaid sick leave, annual leave and severance payment. Employees are entitled to compensation from the Guarantee Fund if they filed for a bankruptcy proceeding. This rule is valid until 30 June 2020.

Employees may have also easier access to the Guarantee Fund if they have not received wage compensations one month from the time the state paid reimbursements to their employers. In these cases, the employer is presumed no longer solvent (presumption is valid until September 2020) and employees may file for a bankruptcy proceeding. If they do so, they are exempt from paying the advance for costs of a bankruptcy proceeding. As for personal bankruptcy and enforcement, the law stipulates that payments under emergency laws are not the object of personal bankruptcy and enforcement. Exceptions are made for wage compensation. Finally, during the COVID-19 epidemic the enforcement proceedings are temporarily suspended. Exemptions are enforcement based on a claim for legal alimony and other urgent matters, determined by the court.","Emergency regulation on insolvency curbs the risks of bankruptcies on the one hand, while protects the interests of workers on the other.

In addition, the employer may impose the taking of rest days placed in a time-saving account.The Ordinance provides for two limits: 1. The employer must give the employee one day's notice. 2. Derogations may concern a maximum of 10 rest days by 31 December 2020.The employer, additionally, may set the dates of leave without taking into account the simultaneous leave entitlements of spouses employed in the same company. The employer may dissociate their leaves if the presence of only one of the two spouses is indispensable to the company, or if one of them has already exhausted his or her paid leave (normally the Labour Code provides that spouses or partners who are employees of the same company are entitled to simultaneous leave).** Sunday rest*The ordinance allows the employer (without collective agreement) to derogate to the Sunday rest. He is allowed to ask employees to work on Sunday. These derogations do not apply to all undertakings, however. They concern firms in sectors deemed essential to the continuity of economic life and national security (the list of which will be laid down by decree) and firms which provide the above mentioned with services necessary for the performance of their main activity. Provisions also apply to companies located in the departments of LaMoselle, Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin, which were hard hit by the Covid crisis.","Potentially, all the private sector employees. ",Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,No special funding required,"The derogation measures related to paid leave have to be set by a sectoral collective agreement (negotiation within the framework of a bi-partite body with the representative social partners) or a company-level agreement with the trade unions. For all other measures, the employer can take unilateral measures and have only to inform the works council.",Bi-or tripartite social dialogue bodies,Negotiated,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041755940; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/file/IAHtqn3D4EKTahYWSsJsVvqldgOONnYNPWktkBcKf3o=/JOE_TEXTE

(the “Act”) in The Country for the Future (the “Program”), Sub-Program 3 “Innovation in Practice”.). The tender is aimed at SMEs only. The program Country for the Future was approved by the government in May 2019, however, the current situation associated with the expansion of COVID- 19 forced government to change the partial focus of the program. Currently, the public tender is thematically aimed at the introduction of new innovative solutions (innovative can be both processes/organisation or products) which can in various respects help to combat the COVID-19 crisis or similar future health threat. Subsidies will also be provided for prevention-related innovations.The total allocation of the programme is CZK 300,000,000 (€11,021,308 approx.).","The projects that can be supported:* in the medical technology and diverse medical, monitoring and other applications, bringing a new or substantially improved manufacturing process or the provision of specialised services;* projects in all sectors of business, aimed at introducing innovative operational, logistical and other organisational processes that reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases to residents, including employees and customers of companies;* projects that increase the degree of digitisation, automation or the ability of the organisation to respond flexibly and in an adaptive way to similar exceptional situations.Amount of subsidy:The program will be able to get a subsidy up to 100% for:* personal expenses;* depreciation and other direct costs, overheads, etc.Up to 25% of project costs may be allocated to project related costs such as:* preparation of the application;* small investments;* marketing  etc. The launch of the solution must begin in the period from 4 April 2020 to 1 September 2020.

BG-2020-11/494,COVID-19: Income support for workers,КОВИД - 19 мярка: Подпомагане на работещите в реалния сектор,Bulgaria,Applies nationwide,03/13/2020,07/31/2021,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,Entirely new measure ,Employment protection and retention,Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work),04/12/2020,"Key tax and spending measures have been implemented under the revised 2020 state budget, allowing for a budget deficit of BGN 3.5 billion (€1.75 billion) and increased ceiling on newly incurred public debt of up to BGN 10 billion (approx. €5 billion) for 2020. By doing so, the Bulgarian government is able to implement a measure that will cover 60% of the wages of employees in affected sectors that would otherwise have been laid off, including the social security contributions that are to be paid by the employers (over 1.2% of 2019 GDP). The application procedure is made as convenient and fast as possible. It can be carried out electronically, in front of the labour offices or through a licensed postal operator. The programme focuses more on the labour market and maintaining employment than on directly supporting business. In this sense, this measure can be considered both economic and social.Three waves of the programme have been announced by now:1. From 13 March 2020 until 30 June 2020;2. from 1 July 2020 until 30 September 2020;3. from 1 October until 31 December 2020.","The Bulgarian government adopted the Emergency and Measures Act to compensate businesses affected by the pandemic. The programme covers companies, whose activities have been prohibited by restrictive measures related to COVID-19 and companies, whose turnover decreased by 20% compared to the same period in 2019.The list of industries that were *not* included in the first wave of the programme (13 March - 30 June 2020) include: agriculture, financial and insurance activities, government, education, human health and social work, households as employers, activities of extraterritorial organisations and services.A requirement for benefiting employers is that they shall not dismiss employees for whom they received wage compensations, after the end of the state of emergency, for an additional period equal to that for which they were compensated. Employers will be able to establish part-time work for the whole enterprise or units of it and at the same time receive compensation in proportion to the reduced working hours.","More than 80% of employees can benefit from the measures and most of the employers in the country. Until mid-April 2020, over 800 companies have benefited from the measure.According to the Employment Agency, the measure known as _'60/40'_ covers 5.4% of the country's workforce. In addition, the measure contributed to keeping unemployment at just over 8% in June. Regionally, the most favourable effect was in the districts of Gabrovo and the capital Sofia, and the weakest - in Vidin and Sofia region. As of 30 June 2020, 10,000 employers' applications for a total of 177,000 employees have been approved and submitted for payment.The NSSI data on the compensations paid under measure 60/40 shows that the average amount of assistance per employee varies, in March it was BGN 308 (€154), in April it increased to BGN 515 (€255) and it dropped again to an average of BGN 400 (€200) in May 2020.According to estimations of the Bulgarian Prime Minister, during the first two waves of the programme, the measure has helped 300,000 workers to retain employment.In September 2020, the Solidarity for Bulgaria Association and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation presented a report that analyses the effectiveness of the current support measure. In the report the researchers argue that there is a considerable delay of payments for many applicants, which worsens the economic climate as employers are left out without necessary resources for months. Furthermore, they criticise the programme's framework for being dependent entirely on employers' decision to apply for the subsidy or not, which in some cases might put workers in unfavourable positions. In addition, the report states that around BGN 330,000 (€165,000) of the paid compensations were returned and there is a missing explanation as to why. Subsequently, the involved associations demand amendments in the scope of the programme which should include:* more initiation rights for the workers;* easier and time efficient application, processing and payment protocol;* transparent data for rejected and returned applications and payments; * subsidies of up to 100% of the wages for employees, earning less than BGN 800 (€400). Before Christmas, the government announced that the scheme will continue to operate until September 2021. For the measure 60/40 next year, BGN 600 million are planned, which will reach the month of September.So far, BGN 627 million have been paid under this measure, and according to the Minister of Social Affairs, between 250,000 and 300,000 jobs have been preserved with it. However, a significant part of the resource remained unspent - in the spring because of it the budget of the Unemployment Fund of the National Social Security Institute was updated by BGN 1 billion",National government; Trade unions; Employers' organisations,,Employers organisation; European Funds; National funds,"The social partners (trade unions and employers' organisations) were involved in the decision-making process on what measures to implement. The government is in constant consultation with them, with further measures to be introduced in the coming weeks.The assessment of employers is that the measure is not effective enough and does not work in the way everyone expected. The unions believe the opposite, as the emphasis is on maintaining employment. However, so far most of the funds provided have not yet been used, which means that not all employers take advantage of this opportunity and apply. The measure is to be extended until the end of the year, given the phase of the business cycle in which the Bulgarian economy finds itself.In October 2020, the Confederation of Employers and Industrialists of Bulgaria demanded extension of the programme until mid-2021, as they do not see market recovery in the close future.In addition, some Media representatives criticised the government for not being transparent enough about the source of the funds and the total amount spent on the programme.

The new amendment gives a legal right to an unemployed person to receive unemployment benefits from the state and at the same time work at a rural stop and take a salary from there.According to unofficial information, the Ministry of Agriculture is also discussing the possibility of workers in enterprises that have been introduced to reduced working hours due to the coronavirus crisis and are being compensated under the [_60/40 scheme_](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/BG-2020-11_494.html), to be able to start additional work in agriculture.","People receiving unemployment or social assistance benefits can earn additional income from seasonal work in agriculture without losing their entitlement to state support. Those who are currently on unpaid leave can also sign a second employment contract without permission from their primary employer. These are the two approved measures that, at the threshold of the active season in agriculture, should divert employees to this sector.Amendments to the Emergency Legislation adopted in April 2020 introduce the possibility for farmers to conclude temporary employment contracts similar to one-day contracts to hire employees for activities such as harvesting. The key change in this case is that the conclusion of such contracts would not affect the receipt of unemployment benefits or social benefits by employees, which in previous years was a serious obstacle to securing seasonal workers on the field.Currently, there is also no limit to the length of time that employees can work under the second employment contract while on unpaid leave. ","The Bulgarian employment agency, operating for the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, estimated that of nearly 100,000 unemployed registered at the labour offices in the country since 13 March 2020 (date of introducing COVID-19 measures), 1,637 people have expressed interest in working in agriculture. They account for 1.6% of the unemployed force. In April 2020, 97 employers announced 1,304 open vacancies for agricultural workers.Between January 2020 and June 2020, more than 73,000 one-day contracts have been registered with 564 farmers, who grow mainly vines, apples and lavender.

This premium is not subject to income tax. This scheme has been renewed in 2020, but is reserved for employers who have set up a profit-sharing scheme in the company's results (""intéressement""). However, this scheme has been modified to take into account the COVID-19 crisis to support purchase power of employees working during the crisis in essential services and all other companies that have stayed open.","According to an ordinance dated 1 April 2020 published in the context of the health crisis, the exceptional purchasing power bonus, that is exempted of social contribution and tax-free, can reach €2,000 for companies that have set up a profit-sharing agreement. Those that do not have one can nevertheless pay the exceptional bonus, but within the limit of €1,000. On the basis of the Article 11 of the emergency law of 23 March 2020 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, an ordinance published on 2 April 2020 relaxes the conditions for payment of the exceptional purchasing power bonus provided for in Article 7 of the law on the financing of social security for 2020 (LFSS 2020). The aim is to encourage companies to make use of this scheme in the context of the epidemic, bearing in mind that the premium can now be paid until 31 August 2020 (instead of 30 June).Companies that do not have a profit-sharing agreement ('accord d'intéressement') can use the bonus by benefiting from these exemptions, if the amount paid does not exceed €1,000. Until now, these companies have been excluded from the measure.For companies which implement a profit-sharing agreement on the date of payment of the bonus, the maximum amount exempted is €2,000 (instead of €1,000 up to now). The profit-sharing agreement may be for a period of between one and three years if it was concluded between 1 January and 31 August 2020, with the deadline of 30 June 2020 being extended. Initially, the exceptional purchase power bonus scheme allowed its amount to be modulated between employees according to remuneration, classification level, length of actual presence during the year or the working time provided for in the employment contract. The ordinance provides for a new possibility of modulation, depending on 'working conditions related to the Covid-19 epidemic'. According to the Ministry of Labour, this new possibility was intended in particular to give companies the possibility of rewarding more people who, for example, are forced to go to their workplace than those who are not obliged to do so.","So far, only 37,000 companies have paid a bonus in 2020. The Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire call to reward employees 'who had the courage to go to their workplace' despite the health crisis.Particularly targeted, large retailers seems to have received the message: Auchan, Carrefour, Intermarché, Lidl, Système U and Leclerc have already announced that their employees would receive a bonus of €1,000. The same goes for the 15,000 Veolia employees who remained in the field to manage water and waste, or for 5,000 employees of the Total group.It should be noted that some companies have not yet made their decision, waiting in particular to assess the effects of the crisis on their cash flow: they now have until August 31 to do so (compared to June 30 initially).",Trade unions; Company / Companies,Companies providing essential services,No special funding required,"To provide a bonus over €1,000 exempted of social contribution and taxes, the employer have to reach an agreement with the representative trade unions, or if there are no trade union, with the works council, or if there is no works council, after a vote of the employee.On 16 March 2021, according to the Ministry of Labour's entourage, the social partners, with the exception of Medef, 'considered that the bonus was a good short-term solution', even if the upgrading of these jobs calls for a long-term reflection (career path, remuneration, etc.).",Direct consultation,Negotiated,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041746313; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041776879; https://beta.liaisons-sociales.fr/Content/DocumentRevues.aspx?params=H4sIAAAAAAAEAMtMSbH1czUAAiMDY0NTA7Wy1KLizPw8WyMDI0OgiJlabmJJSWqRrU9woFpyQaZtcGmSr09morGqcSKMCRRPQRZ3LErOyCxLLYZqzU6ttPV3CnIEAAOO8kprAAAAWKE; https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/cp_prime_macron_precisions_2021.pdf

The CEA points out that despite the best intentions and quick reaction of the adoption of this measure, there are numerous omissions that endanger the business of the entrepreneurs and they cannot be tolerated. The biggest problem appeared in the application methodology itself, because it remained unclear whether entrepreneurs can apply only through the Financial Agency (FINA) portal or they have to do it directly through HAMAG-BICRO. Due to these ambiguities, some entrepreneurs have inacceptable applications, although not through their own fault. The COVID-19 variable capital loan was one of the very important measures to help the economy, but it did not yield the expected results. At the beginning of July two months have passed since closing of the tender, and thousands of entrepreneurs who had applied have yet obtain the results whether they will get a loan or not.

Over 60% of holders of family agricultural holdings are over 55 and less than 4 % under 35. The economic crisis and the previous wartime events have contributed to migratory movements from rural to urban areas, particularly of the younger population, resulting in a general decline in the rural population and an increase in the ageing population. This poses a serious threat to the further development and even survival of the rural areas themselves. Young people are a key resource for the development of a modern and competitive agricultural sector, primarily because of their willingness and ability to adapt easily to technological changes, new practices and changing market conditions which is a requirement to increase productivity and competitiveness. Some achieved progress has come under the question due to the recent crisis.","The target groups of financial instruments Micro loans for rural development are primarily small business entities in the agricultural, processing and forestry sectors.

The measure offers the possibility of settling bills created up to three months before the loan application is received, with significantly less documentation and a prepared Business Plan form. The Business Plan form is quite simple with pages on two-page questions, which significantly shortens the time of preparation of the application and enables easier and faster processing. Due to restricted movement of possible beneficiaries and with the desire to simplify the procedure, the Croatian Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments (HAMAG-BICRO) recommends on-line applications.

Government support will be used. All employees who cannot work due to the situation will be  referred to PAUSE from April 1. During the PAUSE, employees will be provided with a salary compensation in the amount of minimum 60% of regular salary, but not less than HRK 4,250 net (€ 567). This measure will apply equally to employees and management including permanent and seasonal workers. During the PAUSE, a part of employees and management in charge of the crisis will work primarily on maintenance, conservation and facility security duties, while a part of the staff will communicate with guests and partners. The wages of management will be reduced by up to 30% until all employees return to work. Other employees who will work full-time will continue to receive their regular full pay.The Management Board cancelled the General Assembly and with the consent of the Supervisory Board proposed to the General Assembly a withdrawal of dividend payment and to direct these sources into funds for increase liquidity and support measures for the preservation of all jobs. Until the situation improves, Valamar Riviera cannot provide regular services but the company’s goal is not to lose any employee. To prepare on time for RESTART, the company directs its efforts to the development of a new business plan and the preparation of facilities for the start of touristic season.

GB-2020-13/521,Coronavirus business interruption loan scheme for SMEs,Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme,United Kingdom,Applies nationwide,03/23/2020,03/23/2026,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,Entirely new measure ,Supporting businesses to stay afloat,Access to finance,04/12/2020,"As part of the Budget 2020 package, the Government announced that it would provide a new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) to both SMEs and large companies (see separate case). Loans were initially due to be worth up to GBP1.2m to support SMEs. On 17 March, this was increased to GPB5 million. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan. The Government has also said the first 12 months of the loan would be offered interest free, with Government meeting the cost of those interest payments. Initially, the interest free period was due to last 6 months.  The scheme went live on 23 March 2020.The background regulation is the Coronavirus Act 2020, emergency legislation which received Royal Assent on the 25 March after having been fast-tracked through Parliament in just four days.","This temporary scheme aims to allow small and medium businesses across the UK with an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million, which are experiencing lost or deferred revenues to access loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance of up to GBP 5 million for up to 6 years. The government will also make a Business Interruption Payment to cover the first 12 months of interest payments and any lender-levied fees. This means smaller businesses will benefit from no upfront costs and lower initial repayments. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to pre-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs. The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank. There are 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks, as well as challenger banks, asset-based lenders and smaller specialist local lenders.  A business is eligible if:* it is based in the UK* has an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million* has a borrowing proposal which the lender would consider viable, if not for the coronavirus pandemic. To access the scheme, businesses should approach their own provider – ideally via the lender’s website. They may also consider approaching other lenders if they are unable to access the finance they need. Decision-making on eligibility for CBILS is fully delegated to the accredited CBILS lenders. On 25 March, the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority together wrote to Britain’s banking sector with a warning not to allow fundamentally viable companies to collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.Finance terms are up to six years for term loans and asset finance facilities. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years. The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt.At the discretion of the lender, the scheme may be used for unsecured lending for facilities of GBP 250,000 and under. Initially, the eligibility criteria stated that for facilities above GBP 250,000, the lender must establish a lack or absence of security prior to businesses using CBILS. It also stated that if the lender could offer finance on normal commercial terms without the need to make use of the scheme, they should do so. However, these were changed as the scheme progressed. Thus, on the 2 April 2020, the Government made changes to the scheme, namely:* No personal guarantees for facilities under GBP 250k: Personal guarantees of any form cannot be taken under the scheme for any facilities below GBP 250k.* Personal guarantees for facilities above GBP 250k: Personal guarantees may still be required, at a lender’s discretion, but recoveries under these are capped at a maximum of 20% of the outstanding balance of the CBILS facility after the proceeds of business assets have been applied. A Principal Private Residence (PPR) cannot be taken as security to support a personal guarantee or as security for a CBIL backed facility.* Security: For all facilities, including those over GBP 250,000, CBILS can now support lending to smaller businesses even where a lender considers there to be sufficient security, making more smaller businesses eligible to receive the business interruption payment.The Government announced that these changes should be retrospectively applied by lenders for any CBILS facilities offered since 23 March 2020. For any commercial (non-CBILS) facilities offered since the same date, providing the borrower meets the CBILS eligibility criteria, lenders have been asked to bring these facilities onto CBILS wherever possible (e.g. where the lender is accredited to offer the same facility through CBILS) and changes retrospectively applied as necessary.","By the 19 July (the latest available data), the CBILS had received a total of 112,212 applications (this figure includes approved applications, applications that are still to be processed, applications that have been declined or turn out not to be eligible as well as withdrawn applications, where borrowers decide not to proceed). This number also includes a number of applications that have subsequently been converted to applications for the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS scheme) - see the [specific case for this new initiative](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/GB-2020-19/944). The number of facilities/loans approved by the 19 July was 55,674 with a value of GBP 12.20 billion (HM Treasury, 2020).By the 20 September (the latest available data), the number of facilities/loans approved under the scheme was 66,585 with a value of GBP 15.4 billion (HM Treasury, 2020).",National government,SMEs,National funds,"Assume that there was discussion/consultation with the small business associations, There was discussion with the banking and finance industry.",Unknown,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme; https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents; https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-treasury-coronavirus-covid-19-business-loan-scheme-statistics; https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-outlines-winter-economy-plan; https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-treasury-coronavirus-covid-19-business-loan-scheme-statistics

The Coronavirus Act 2020 is the major piece of legislation covering the government response.As part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). This recognises that prior to the crisis, companies often sell short-term debt ('commercial paper') to the market as a quick and effective way of raising working capital/ Thus, under CCFF, the Bank of England will instead buy this short-term debt.","As part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF).

Section 39 is the relevant regulation (which amends The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992); this section gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.","In Budget 2020, the UK Government announced that Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be met in full for up to 14 days per employee. The Chancellor estimates that this will cost up to GBP 2 billion and help up to 2 million businesses. In its factsheet on government support for those affected by Covid-19, HM Treasury said that the eligibility criteria for the scheme would be as follows:* this refund will cover up to 2 weeks’ SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19;* employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible; the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020;* employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19;* employers should maintain records of staff absences, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note;* eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of Statutory Sick Pay to self-isolators comes into force;• the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible. Existing systems are not designed to facilitate employer refunds for SSP47.SSP is the minimum that employers have to pay out to qualifying sick employees. It is currently paid at GBP 94.25 per week (GBP 95.85 from 6 April 2020) and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. In order to qualify for SSP, an employee’s average weekly earnings must be above GBP 118 (GBP 120 from 6 April 2020). Some employers may pay enhanced sick pay over and above the SSP rate. This would be detailed in an employment contract. The self-employed are not eligible for SSP. The Statutory Sick Pay (General) (Coronavirus Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/287) came into force on 13 March 2020. These Regulations (as amended) make it clear in law that employees are entitled to SSP if they are unable to work because they are self-isolating as a result of them or someone in their household showing symptoms of coronavirus.  Normally, SSP is paid from the fourth day of absence. However, on the 28 March, the Government made the Statutory Sick Pay (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Waiting Days and General Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/374). These provide that SSP is payable from the first day of absence where a worker is self-isolating because they or someone in their household has shown symptoms of coronavirus. The Regulations have retrospective from 13 March 2020.Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.The guidance says that employers will be covered in the following circumstances: If employers are: * claiming for an employee who’s eligible for sick pay due to coronavirus* had a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started on or before 28 February 2020* had fewer than 250 employees on 28 February 2020.The scheme covers all types of employment contracts, including:* full-time employees* part-time employees* employees on agency contracts* employees on flexible or zero-hour contracts.","Uptake currently unknown as there is no data available at this stage. It will apply to those employees working in organisations employing 250 or under, who are away from work due to coronavirus. This also applies if such employees are self-isolating due to a member of their household being unwell with the virus.

Futhermore, the Minister of Labour announced the postponement of the entry into force of the second part of the unemployment insurance reform, initially scheduled for 1 April 2020. The new rules, which modified the calculations of the duration of compensation and the reference daily wage used to determine the amount of the back-to-work allowance, are therefore postponed to an entry into force on 1 September 2020. These rules are less favourable to jobseekers.","This measure apply to:- all jobseekers receiving unemployment benefit who reach the end of their entitlement during the month of March, whether they are seasonal, temporary workers or intermittent performers;- jobseekers who may have worked again during the period they are entitled to employment benefit, and who may therefore extend the duration of their entitlement to unemployment benefit;- beneficiaries of the Specific Solidarity Allowance (ASS) whose renewal takes place in March; the renewal of rights will be studied at the end of the confinement period.Payment of unemployment benefit will be extended until the end of the confinement period. This additional compensation will not reduce any future entitlements.The extension is automatic on the part of public employment service (Pôle Emploi) and is effective for payments since the beginning of April. Jobseekers are still required to keep up to date. On the other hand, job search monitoring is suspended during the entire period of confinement. No jobseeker will be struck off the list or sanctioned during this period, ensures a question and answer published on the Pôle emploi website.A decree published on 14 April provides that the payment of benefits to the unemployed at the end of their rights will go at least 'until the end of the calendar month in which the end of the confinement occurs', details the Ministry of Labour. At this stage, it would therefore be until 31 May 2020. But 'this date will be extended in case of a new extension of the containment measure', the ministry specifies.","According to the daily Les Echos, between 60,000 and 90,000 jobseekers should arrive at the end of the allowance period in March. It can be estimated a similar number of April.

They should do in sufficient time so that HMRC do not attempt to automatically collect on receipt of your VAT return.On 26 March, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) issued further guidance on this scheme. This underlines that HMRC will not charge interest or penalties on any amount deferred as a result of the Chancellor’s announcement. Businesses will still need to submit their VAT returns on time. VAT payments due following the end of the deferral period will have to be paid as normal, and HMRC have stated that further information about how to repay deferred VAT will be available soon.","As of the 7 April, 342,000 payments were eligible for deferral, with 140,000 payments deferred by businesses.

In a later step, this was extended to workers with care needs for older people and can now be taken day wise. The employer's consent is needed.The legal basis was an amendment to the employment law act § 18b Abs. 1 Arbeitsvertragsrechts-Anpassungsgesetz (AVRAG).","The employer's consent to the special care time is needed. The costs for the leave are shared between the state (which pays one third) and the employer (two thirds). Eligibility ends with a monthly wage of €5,370 (upper threshold).The special care period is available for all those employees whose work is not necessary for the maintenance of the business and who do not have other childcare opportunities (schools and kindergartens remain open only for children of those parents whose work is necessary for the maintenance of the business).The special care time is not to be offset against regular holiday entitlements or claims for time off or 'flexitime' credits. It is regarded as a 'normal' period of employment, and therefore counts towards employees' entitlements dependent on length of service. The legal base is an adaptation of the Employment Law Amendment Act (AVRAG, §18b/1).","According to the answer to a parliamentary inquiry, 4,874 people were released from work, the majority of whom were women, namely 3,501, which corresponds to a share of 72%. Within the scope of this special leave, 5,490 children up to the age of 14 were looked after. In addition, 30 people with disabilities and 22 people in need of care were looked after.**Figures from May and June**According to the Federal Accounting Agency, relating to figures from May, only 10% of the recipients availed of the maximum amount of three weeks of childcare time. Until May 25, only four applications were rejected. Up until then, €365,257.61 had been paid out in funding amounts. Up to €2.5 million were budgeted. Earlier media reports from 23 June 2020 reported that according to ministry information, almost 9,500 families had made use of the measure, but in light of the most recent update, this seems much overrated. **Figures from August**According to information provided by the Federal Chancellery in late August 2020, around 30,000 children have benefited from the special care period and more than 25,000 employees have taken advantage of the special care period. Of these, 66% were women and 34% were men. 57% have taken advantage of the special care time of up to three weeks, 22% up to two weeks and 21% up to one week. 3,841 companies have so far submitted 4,385 applications for special care time.

Also self-employed people with income losses will be eligible for this support.","Measures against child poverty are to be strengthened, the Federal Minister for Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection, Mr. Anschober said: There are now payments to families who have been pushed into short-time work or unemployment by the current crisis. The previous family hardship compensation fund has been increased by €30 million which is now available for single payments to those affected. From 15 April 2020, parents who had been employed until 28 February and are now on short-time work or have become unemployed due to the crisis are eligible. Self-employed people with losses could also apply for payment. This applies to families with children who receive family allowance. The payment is valid for three months, but is paid once at the beginning and does not have to be paid back.The exact amount of support depends on previous income. Federal Minister for Labour, Family and Youth, Ms. Aschbacher cited as an example of  a family with two children and €3,000 net family income, which would receive €780 for three months after the father's unemployment. The aim is to compensate for the loss of income due to unemployment or short-time work, the Minister said. The upper limit of monthly payments lies at €1,200.","By mid-June, only about €6 million out of the €30 million available from the Corona family hardship fund had been paid due to the very high numbers of applications (over 100,000) which initially exceeded the capacities of the ministry. However, resources were increased and administrative improvements were made to avoid delays in payment. By 21 September 2020, 50,000 cases have been processed and approved. The average amount paid out is €1,250 per family, according to the Parliamentary Committee for Family and Youth.On 30 December 2020, family minister Ms Aschbacher stated that in 2020, 72,500 families received benefits from the fund. In total, €96 million (of the €100 million available) were exhausted.

The landlord may not claim the arrears of payment in court until the end of 31 December 2020 or cover them from a deposit handed over by the tenant.In addition, the landlord may not legally demand payment of rent due between 1 April and 30 June 2020 until the end of 31 December 2020, nor may he/she cover it from a security deposit provided by the tenant.

Many people are even more concerned with how they should pay their next electricity bill.Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Green Party) and Wolfgang Urbantschitsch (Board Member of E-Control) explained why these concerns are unfounded. Even if there are payment difficulties, there will be no shutdowns on the part of the energy suppliers.","Until further notice, in any case until 1 May 2020, _'no one in Austria will turn off electricity, gas or heat,'_ the Minister and the E-Control board assured. This applies to the population, but also to micro and small companies. Energy minister Ms Gewessler said it was a quick and unbureaucratic consensus in the industry. _'This is a good and important contribution,'_ said the Green politician. However, this is not a legally fixed regulation. The energy suppliers would share the risk with the network operators, said the minister responsible for energy and the environment. According to Urbantschitsch, it is also possible to arrange a deferral of payments or an installment plan with the utilities, or at most a reduction of advance payments for companies, since there is a reduction in energy consumption for company closings.**Chamber of Labour AK favours legal regulation**The major energy suppliers for electricity and gas have already announced that they will not switch off during the Corona crisis. The AK also expressly welcomes this voluntary principal. ""But all energy suppliers, including small and above all local and district heating suppliers, have to be brought on board,"" says Christa Schlager , head of the economic policy department at the AK. That seems to have succeeded with Thursday's agreement.According to E-Control, there were around 43,000 shutdowns in electricity and around 4,000 in gas in 2018.

However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.This measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  ","In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists. According to the current tax rules adopted, the owners pay between HRK 150 and 1,500 (€ 20 -200) per bed in annual taxes. The amount is determined by the Assembly of the municipality. If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (€100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. The amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than HRK 150,00, nor more than HRK 1.500,00. If the representative body does not decide on the amount of the lump-sum tax (per bed/accommodation unit in the campsite/accommodation unit in the Robinson tourism facility), the lump-sum tax is set at HRK 750.00.representative body of the local self-government unit.","Not yet known at this stage.

This quick initiation was possible because the country had already prepared to start electronic prescriptions in a pilot project in two political districts in the regional province in Carinthia in April 2020. The measure is targeted especially to those who need long-term medication. It stands to be seen whether it will be prolonged after the Corona crisis is over.In addition to the electronic prescription, further measures for the period of the pandemic were introduced, including for instance the suspension of the authorization requirement (chief physician requirement) for many medications. Furthermore, ambulance transports are free of charge until further notice; the same applies to medical aids and aids up to a total of €1,500 as well as X-ray and cross-sectional examinations. Sickness reports to doctors are currently also possible by telephone. Doctors, psychotherapists and midwives can also invoice necessary telemedical treatments (via Skype, video conference or telephone) such as a service performed in the ordination.","The procedure of getting an electronic recipe is that the patient calls the doctor's office. The doctor issues the prescription and saves it in the patient's (pre-existing) e-medication. The information reaches the pharmacy automatically via e-medication. There, the patients can either pick up the medicine themselves or send someone.In cases where e-medication is not working or is not yet working, doctors were also given the opportunity to send prescriptions to the pharmacies by fax or email. The electronic prescription is primarily intended to help older people and people with previous illnesses to avoid medical practices as best they can given the spread of coronavirus in Austria. Accordingly, the measure is mainly intended for people with long-term medication. However, in principle, it is also possible that the doctor prescribes medication for acute cases.

To counteract this, a package of measures was first presented by the government on 19 March 2020. The criminal prosecution of the perpetrators would be further ensured, entry and proximity bans would be further pronounced, and directions would be implemented. This would mean that the police can give those affected by domestic violence applications for an injunction against violent partners at first contact and take the completed forms with them on inspection visits a few days later. Applications can also be submitted electronically. The removal of violent offenders would also be guaranteed in quarantine areas. On 5 April, new measures where presented and figures showing a slight decrease in the number of domestic violence cases.","When presenting measures in mid-March, it was emphasised that the 24-hour helpline had been increased in terms of funding and staff and that online advice for women at risk of violence was expanded. Furthermore, information brochures on the protection against violence were being published, to be distributed in supermarkets. A professional online help and advice service (""help chat"") has been available from 19 March 2020 every day from 3 pm to 10 pm for women and girls affected by violence, in several languages (German, English, Turkish, Farsi / Dari (Persian), Russian, Bulgarian and Arabic).On 5 April, the interior minister presented a new campaign ‘Safe at home’ (Halt der Gewalt), which is designed to help women with violent partners. He appealed to victims of domestic violence, mostly women and children, not to remain silent. Police officers would know exactly what to do in a specific case, they were ‘trained to decide exactly that’ - and also for prevention.There has been extensive information and services on the subject of violence in the family on the website of the Ministry of the Interior, and additional advertisements since Sunday. The Ministry has announced ‘Prevention Spots’ as well. The information is available in several languages.","The number of bans on entering and approaching the home, which can be issued by police officers who intervene to remove perpetrators of violence from their private surroundings and thus protect victims, rose throughout Austria from 886 in February to 1,081 in the lockdown month of April. In the months that followed, it settled roughly at this slightly higher level: In July there were 1,085 such distance requirements for violent persons, in August 1,055, and by mid-September 507 such distance requirements had been imposed on violent people. In the vast majority of cases it concerned men who abused women and children.The need for anti-violence counselling has increased considerably due to the restrictions on starting school and multiple family burdens from home schooling and home office. The women's helpline has registered 38 percent more calls since the start of the lockdown, and the new help chat at haltdergewalt.at has received around 900 inquiries since then.According to a survey by the opinion research institute (OGM) on 21 September 2020, 4% of those interviewed perceived more private acts of violence in their surroundings during the lockdown.

Due to travel bans, maintaining this care has become a major problem. But also those who are cared for by family members may encounter capacity problems, as well as those in older people's homes or care homes, when staff get sick or are in quarantine.Thus, the government has announced to provide a specific COVID-Fund worth €100 million for the 460,000 persons in need of care, to be distributed among Austria's nine federal states (as nursing care lies within their competencies). It lies within the regional states' responsibility on how to invest this money. For example, some federal states have made exceptions to travel bans for care workers from the above mentioned countries.","The implementation of the special funds from the 100 million € fund for those in need of long-term care will is left to the regional states. The money is to flow into the expansion of hotlines, more staff and spatial resources. According to the Minister of Health, it would not be possible for the existing care situation to be maintained everywhere. The goal would be to“ create resources so that nobody stays alone ”. The federal government will make the capacities available to the states that have been freed up by the closure of the spa and nursing homes. In addition, civilian servants (Zivildiener) are used to relieve the personnel situation (see separate entry AT-2020-11/463 in this database), even if they are to be used for basic care only.

This was on top of a series of measures announced at Budget 2020 on the 12 March, where the government announced GBP 30 billion of additional support for public services, individuals and businesses experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.  Changes to SSP were part of the initial Budget package, subsequently extended on the 17 March, and accounted for in Sections 39 to 44 of the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 40 amends the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.  Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the changes in SSP will be back-dated to 13th of March.","In order to traditionally qualify for SSP (currently £94.25 and payable by employers for a maximum of 28 weeks), there is a wait of three days before an individual employee becomes eligible. However, under the new ruling, SSP will be paid from day 1, rather than day 4 of an individual's absence from work if that person is absent from work due to sickness or the need to self-isolate caused by COVID-19. This applied retrospectively from the 13th of March. Moreover, from the 20th of March onwards, those who have COVID-19 or who are advised to self-isolate will be able to obtain an “isolation note” by visiting the National Health Service (NHS) 111 online and completing an online form, rather than visiting a doctor. For COVID-19 cases, this replaces the usual need to provide a “fit note” after seven days of sickness absence. For those not eligible for SSP e.g. the self-employed or those earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of GBP 118 per week, but who have COVID-19 or are advised to self-isolate, the government says that they can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit (UC) or new style Employment and Support Allowance. For those who are self-employed and receiving Universal Credit with COVID-19 or advised to self-isolate, the requirements of the Minimum Income Floor will be temporarily relaxed. This change took effect on 13 March and will last for the duration of the outbreak, to ensure that self-employed UC claimants will receive support.",,National government,Employees in standard employment,National funds,"The Chancellor is reported to have met and worked with trade unions and business groups, in order to support peoples' financial security. There is evidence on Hansard (official record of proceedings in Parliament) that the  Chancellor 'spoke to the trade unions' on the 18th of March and on the 19th of March, he met with the TUC, the CBI, the BCC and the FSB. This was done with a view to urgently developing new forms of employment support to help protect people’s jobs and incomes through this period (see https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2020-03-19/debates/8B1662BD-F065-4731-AA48-5BA21424C2D0/Covid-19EmploymentSupport). There are no explicit details of discussion.Previously, the TUC had called for changes to the SSP system. On the 18th of March, the TUC stated that the sick pay system is 'broken', stating that at a maximum of £94.25 per week, Statutory sick pay (SSP) is not enough to live on. The TUC further averred that the average worker earns £512 per week, so for the estimated 7 million people who may come to rely on SSP, any time off work will constitute 'a large income shock.'The TUC also pointed out that many people aren’t eligible for SSP, as approximately 2 million people do not qualify for such payments due to the fact that they do not meet the lower earnings limit of £118 per week. The TUC criticised the Chancellor for not extending eligibility for sick pay to these lower earners; he instead pointed them to the benefit system. He has announced minor improvements to the way the benefit system operates, but the TUC is still critical that the system will fail to provide appropriate support, mainly due to the five-week wait for first payment and the low level of benefits then provided (Employment and Support Allowance is just £73.10).The TUC thus called on the government to remove the lower earnings limit for qualification for sick pay. It also urged the government to immediately increase the weekly level of SSP (£94.25) to at least the equivalent of a week’s pay at the Real Living Wage, as well as to end the five-week wait for benefits (see https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/coronavirus-help-what-workers-need-now).",Unknown,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878995/Covid-19_fact_sheet.pdf; https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents; https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19; https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works

This includes landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19. Where a tenant is experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19, the government will ensure they do not face the threat of eviction for at least three months:* The government has agreed with mortgage lenders that they will offer repayment holidays of three months to households in financial difficulty due to COVID-19.* This will also apply to landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.* The offer of a payment holiday can be made available to customers who are up to date with payments and not already in arrears.* Customers who are concerned about their current financial situation should contact their lender at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss whether this is a suitable option for them.* Under the Coronavirus Act, landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a three month period.

Owners entered the crisis with lower average housing costs and a bigger financial buffer than renters, and have also been more successful at directly reducing housing costs in recent weeks. While just one-in-twelve home owners applying for a mortgage holiday have been refused, that figure stands at one-in-two for those renters who have sought a rent reduction. While the social security system potentially offers a (more generous) backstop for renters, eligibility rules and caps leave some renters without adequate support.

Industrial relations are poorly developed, a sectoral collective agreement is not in place; a statutory minimum wage is set by a sectoral minimum wage commission composed of various stakeholders. Major church-related organisations, NGO and private employers do not engage in collective bargaining; employers criticize the underfinancing of the statutory heath insurance.   Against this background the new sectoral agreement on a COVID-19 bonus for health care workers is a very new development. Some NGO founded the employer organisation BVAP for changing employment relations in the sector by engaging in collective bargaining. Wage negotiations with the United Services Union ver.di are ongoing since late 2019. Business organisations are highly critical of the new agreement saying that they do not see where the money shall come from. The collective bargaining partners BVAP and ver.di wish for their agreements - this one as well as future ones - to be extended by the labour minister.","The agreement covers skilled and unskilled care workers as well as workers in managerial positions in residential care homes and in ambulant care.

For this, the Executive has approved that, in the event that a company suspends its activity due to the health crisis, the temporary contracts that its workers have (including training, relief and interim contracts) are also suspended. After this crisis, the duration of these eventual contracts will be prolonged for the time they have been suspended.","The suspension of temporary contracts, including training, relief and interim contracts, for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of March 17, will mean the computation will be interrupted, both for the duration of these contracts, as well as the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period, in each of these contractual modalities, with respect to the workers affected by them.Article 5 of RDL 9/2020 provides that the suspension of temporary contracts for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of RDL 8/2020, including training, relief and interim contracts, means the interruption of the computation of both the duration of such contracts as of the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period.Thus, RDL 9/2020 does not indicate that the causes of force majeure, or the economic, technical, organizational or production related to the COVID-19 constitute an enabling budget so that the parties can proceed directly to the suspension of the temporary employment contracts. On the contrary, RDL 8/2020 refers to the suspensions of contracts decided by the company, after confirmation of the force majeure by the competent Labor Authority, or after processing the consultative and negotiating period. Therefore, the paralysis of the effects of the reciprocal obligations of the parties to the temporary contract requires that the causes concur and that the expressed procedural rules have been followed. It is for these assumptions and conditions that it is established that the suspension also has the additional, and exceptional, effect of interrupting the calculation of the term of life or duration of the temporary contract.The norm refers to temporary contracts in general, although it is specified that training, relief and interim contracts are included.The interruption of the calculation means that the period of suspension of the contract does not count for the purposes of determining neither the agreed term of validity nor the maximum duration.

Many self-employed people face major challenges, and this requires further initiatives. Therefore, has the government together with all the parties in the Parliament passed a new temporary compensation scheme for the self-employed.The scheme for self-employed people was first introduced with the political agreement on 1 April 2020 targeting companies that lost revenue from 9 March through 8 June 2020. However, the scheme was partly reopened two times in December 2020, first with a new political agreement on 9 December 2020 due the introduction of new restrictions in 38 municipalities and secondly due the introduction of the restrictions in a total of 69 municipalities. Finally, on 15 December, it was decided to roll out the compensation scheme to the rest of Denmark, in total 98 municipalities.To get compensation, the companies must apply for compensation on the Danish Commerce Agency's corporate portal for companies.

This means, for example, a half-time employee equivalent to half a full-time employee, etc. The business owner and employee spouse do not count in the ten full-time employees.* Have expected loss of at least 30% due to coronavirus / COVID-19.With the first political agreement on April 2020, companies could apply for compensation for lost revenue in the period from 9 March through 8 June 2020. But with the new political agreement on December 2020, companies can again apply for compensation for lost revenue in the period from 9 December 2020 through 3 January 2021.State compensation is 75% of the revenue loss, however, a maximum of 23,000 kr. per month corresponding to the rates in the salary compensation scheme for salaried employees agreed with the social partners in the tripartite agreement.The compensation may amount to up to DKK 34,500 per month, if the self-employed has a spouse employed.Self-employed or small businesses can receive maximum compensation for three months from 9 March until 9 June.

They requested that opening hours should be limited to 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for the duration of the school closings for retail shops, as the measures would put many of the 400,000 domestic retail employees in a bind and demanded that the opening times in the shops .Initially, the employers organisation (WKÖ) had rejected the union's demand for a temporary and significant reduction in working hours. 'The trade is fundamentally against any legal shortening of the opening times' said WKÖ trade chairman Peter Buchmüller. The food trade in particular is an important infrastructure for maintaining the security of supply for the entire population and is 'well equipped'. Due to the recent measures by the federal government, the shopping behavior of Austrians has changed. Social partners notice that customers shop less often, but buy more. The customer frequency decreases at a later hour. Therefore, the commercial social partners have agreed to adjust the opening hours accordingly. In a joint protection package for employees and apprentices in the Austrian trade, we have agreed that the shops will be open from Monday, March 23, 2020, from 7:40 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. Normal opening hours (i.e. like before) could be resumed in May again, after the legal regulation had expired.On 23 March 2020, social partners agreed on a package of measures to protect retail employees.","The social partner agreement finally foresees that retail shops will be open until 7 pm.Further protective measures include that  * pregnant employees will be exempted from work;* employees belonging to the COVID-19 risk group shall - if possible - be working in areas without client contact;* a tax free treatment of Corona related supplements or rewards; Social partners appeal to the Federal government to consider this.Initiative of the social partners for uniform standards for the protection of employees in the workplace.

This might include (but will not be limited to) recently retired professionals and students who are near the end of their training. Registered staff can then be used appropriately, with decisions made on a local basis, to increase the available health and social care workforce and enable essential health and care services to function during the height of the epidemic;* enable regulators to temporarily add social workers to their registers who may have recently left the profession. This will ensure vital continuity of care for vulnerable children and adults;* enable employees and workers to take Emergency Volunteer Leave in blocks of 2, 3 or 4 weeks’ statutory unpaid leave and establish a UK-wide compensation fund to compensate for loss of earnings and expenses incurred at a flat rate for those who volunteer through an appropriate authority. This will ensure that volunteers do not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of performing a public good. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of health and social care services and are particularly important in caring for the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly, those with multiple long-term conditions or those suffering from mental ill-health;* provide indemnity for clinical negligence liabilities arising from NHS activities carried out for the purposes of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, where there is no existing indemnity arrangement in place. This will ensure that those providing healthcare service activity across the UK are legally protected for the work they are required to undertake as part of the COVID-19 response. This is in line with and will complement existing arrangements; * suspend the rule that currently prevents some NHS staff who return to work after retirement from working more than 16 hours per week, along with rules on abatements and drawn-down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work. This will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and also allow retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.","More than 60,000 retired doctors and nurses who had retired in the last three years were written to and told ""Your NHS Needs You"", urged to come back to the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.  Student nurses and medical students are also being offered temporary work as the health service struggles to cope with rising demand and growing staff shortages.  Officials said those who join the ""NHS Army"" by re-registering with regulators will be assessed to see what kind of help they could offer in the battle against the pandemic.On the 27th of March, retired police officers were also asked to return to work, in either a voluntary or paid capacity. Those officers nearing thirty years' pensionable service have also been asked to delay retirement. The request came as one in five police officers were off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus. The Met, which is Britain’s biggest force, is already understood to be experiencing absentee rates of 20%. This already high figure came before London hits its peak, with officers and staff missing because they have contracted the virus or are having to self-isolate.Finally, the Government and NHS England called for a 'volunteer army' to help the vulnerable during the coronavirus crisis. Over 750,000 people in just four days signed up the NHS's call for volunteers, three times the original target. On the 7th of April, the Royal Voluntary Service, the charity delivering the volunteer effort, completed checks for the three quarters of a million applications and from the 8th, the NHS Volunteer Responders will support 2.5 million at risk people. Their duties will include: delivering medicines from pharmacies;  driving patients to appointments; bringing them home from hospital; •making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home; and transporting medical supplies and equipment for the NHS.Thousands of these approved volunteers will be offered tasks from the 8th via the GoodSAM app and will start helping people safely, with more expected to get requests over the coming weeks as referrals ramp up.Health professionals, pharmacists and local authorities can upload requests for help on the NHS Volunteer Responders referrer’s portal and volunteers pick the job they want to do that day and close the task once complete.  Volunteers show themselves as available when their app is switched to ‘on duty’.","750,000 volunteers signed up to assist NHS England.	The call for retired NHS staff resulted in 11,788 retired medical staffers returning to work, including 2,660 doctors and 6,147 nurses.

In addition to artists, cultural mediators can now apply for this grant. The amount paid out by the KSVF corresponds to that of the hardship fund. The fund consists of two phases:* in the first phase €1,000 are paid as emergency aid (until 2 July 2020), * in the second phase (starting on 10 July 2020), a one-time payment of €3,000 is paid (amount received from phase one is deducted)A separate service page has been set up for loss of income due to the Corona measures: KSVF service fund.Individual funds run by copyright collecting societies (e.g. music, visual arts, film-making, etc.).

Thus, the agreement offers a fixed wage compensation of 75% to the companies covering the employees that instead of losing their job are send home from the company with the possibility to return. The measure applies to all companies in the private sector. ","The agreement covers all companies that due to the severe consequences of COVID-19 have to dismiss 30% of the employed or minimum 50 employees from the company. The government offers wage compensation to the companies for the employees that were to be dismissed but instead, according to the agreement, will be send home with a perspective to return. The compensation for a (monthly paid) salaried employee is 75% of the wage or maximum of DKK 30,000. For an hourly paid employee the compensation is 90% or a maximum of DKK 30,000.This agreement was concluded on 30 March 2020 and is an amendment of a first agreement from the 12 March 2020. In the first agreement the compensation for salaried employees were 75% but maximum DKK 23,000. For hourly paid employees, the compensation were 90% with a maximum of DKK 26,000. With the amendment, the maximum amount for both is DKK 30,000. The aim of the increased amount is to make it possible for more companies to participate.","The Danish Business Authority (Erhvervsstyrelsen) posts weekly updates of usage of the different compensation schemes. As of 28 June 2021 the latest numbers for the wage compensation schemes are: * Number of approved applications: 96,009* Number of companies: 36,799* Number of compensated employees: 335,546	* Total compensation paid: DKK 17,714 million (€2,38 million) ",National government; Social partners jointly; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,National funds,"Overall the views on the measure are positive and in hindsight the decisions that were made to support employees and companies are deemed to have been the correct ones for the best outcome post pandemic. DA mentions their involvement in the 2020 tripartite agreements as their most important contribution in relation to corona, and states the cooperation to have been good. The Danish Model is stated as strong and being able to deliver. A main aim of the wage compensation scheme has been to retain the workers in the companies for an efficient start up post pandemic, and this is seen as very successful by both sides. However, one of DA's aims was to ensure compensation for companies for the negative effect of the political involvement, and while it was partially successful, companies have paid great amounts in keeping their employees. This issue is also discussed by the CEO of SMVdanmark (SMEdenmark), which organises 18,000 SME. He states a lack of understanding from the government and social partners on especially SMEs, which have drained their economy during the long pandemic in keeping their employees and suggest a full coverage of wages towards the final period of the scheme (stated as the scheme was extended in March to June).",Bi-or tripartite social dialogue bodies,Negotiated,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.fm.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser/2020/03/regeringenogarbejdsmarkedets-parter-styrker-trepartsaftalen-om-midlertidig-loenkompensation; https://www.fm.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser/2020/03/trepartsaftale-skal-hjaelpe-loenmodtagere; https://bm.dk/nyheder-presse/pressemeddelelser/2020/06/regeringen-og-arbejdsmarkedets-parter-udfaser-gradvist-loenkompensationsordningen/ ; https://erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/statistik-kompensationsordninger; https://bm.dk/nyheder-presse/pressemeddelelser/2020/12/loenkompensation-bliver-nu-genindfoert-i-hele-landet-i-alle-brancher/; https://bm.dk/media/15436/aftale-om-loenkompensationsordning.pdf; https://bm.dk/media/15437/tillaegsaftale-til-aftale-om-loenkompensation-af-10-december.pdf; https://www.danskerhverv.dk/presse-og-nyheder/nyheder/skarpede-restriktioner-og-lonkompensation/; file:///C:/Users/fqj942/Downloads/A20210015830.pdf; https://erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/statistik-kompensationsordninger; https://bm.dk/nyheder-presse/pressemeddelelser/2021/03/trepartsaftale-om-loenkompensation-forlaenget-til-30-juni-2021/; https://www.stm.dk/media/10258/rammeaftale-om-plan-for-genaabning-af-danmark.pdf; https://bm.dk/nyheder-presse/pressemeddelelser/2021/04/ansatte-paa-loenkompensation-faar-mulighed-for-at-forberede-genaabning-af-deres-virksomheder/; https://bm.dk/media/17668/trepartsaftale-om-tilpasning-af-loenkompensationsordningen.pdf; https://via.ritzau.dk/pressemeddelelse/smvdanmark-uaendret-lonkompensationen-efterlader-virksomhederne-i-stikken?publisherId=13559667&releaseId=13618871; https://www.da.dk/politik-og-analyser/beskaeftigelse/2020/de-vigtigste-ting-da-har-opnaaet-i-2020/; https://erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/statistik-kompensationsordninger

It allows young companies to be able to finance themselves with a working loan to retain staff if there are other reasons not to take advantage of the 60:40 measure. The bank considers a possibility to make the credits interest-free over the period of the coronavirus crisis.The portfolio guarantee applied by the Fund may also be used after the end of the period of emergency and, according to the Fund, is a suitable product for financial recovery at a time when banks would again be uncertain about lending to the business.","The Fund of the Bulgarian Development Bank will provide banks with guarantees worth of BGN 170 million (approx. €85 million), and expects them to provide loans of up to BGN 850 million (€425 million), mainly for small and medium-sized enterprises, in the next one year. The Microcredit Fund tool is aimed at small companies - the so-called micro-enterprises, as well as companies that have just started their business (to have up to three years of business history at the moment, with possible expansion - up to five years).The idea is to enable banks to support this vulnerable group of start-ups that may have started a small family business with loans up to BGN 50,000 (€25,000). This will support their investment plans for the crisis and working capital so that they can continue their operations.This tool is aimed at a target group of recipients who generally do not have easy access or have no access to bank financing at all - companies with no credit history.","As of 17 December 2020, financial agreements have been signed with 8 banks with a total amount of portfolio guarantees of BGN 649,000,000.

Although in Royal Decree-Law 9/2020 measures were established so that, in the event of suspension of contracts, the computation of temporary contracts is interrupted, this provision does not totally prevent the termination of temporary contracts after the declaration of the state of alarm that are not covered by the system established for unemployed people for having been affected by the suspension or reduction of working hours established in articles 22 and 23 of Royal Decree-Law 8/2020.","Beneficiaries of the exceptional unemployment subsidy due to the end of a temporary contract will be workers who have had a fixed-term contract expired for at least two months, after the entry into force of Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14, declaring the state of alarm for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19, and they will not have the necessary contribution to access another benefit or subsidy if they lack income under the terms established in article 275 of the consolidated text of the General Law on Social Security, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 8/2015, of October 30.This subsidy will be granted to the workers affected, in the terms referred to in the previous paragraph, for the termination of a fixed-term contract, including interim, training and relief contracts, and that meet the rest of the requirements provided in this article.The exceptional subsidy consists of a monthly aid of 80% of the Public Multiple Effects Income Indicator (IPREM) in force and its payment.

(IV. 10.) the aim of the measure is to prevent layoffs in face of the COVID-19 crisis. This measure follows the German example of Kurzarbeit, but is on a much smaller scale with a lot of narrowing criteria the applicant must fulfill. The support can be extended from 1 May 2020 for three months. The amount of the income support will be transferred directly from the state to the employee while the reduced wage will be paid by the employer.","Businesses who are shedding 30-50% of working time of employees compared with their pre-covid situation who can prove that their orders have not fallen by more than 50% and are working towards the “interests of the national economy” were eligible. For every employee that is considered for layoff the state agrees to pay 70% of the part of the salary that was lost due to the worktime reduction. Only the part of salaries up to HUF 214,300 net (twice the minimum wage - €612 as of 15 Apr) per month receive the income supplement, earnings after that threshold are not subsidised. The government calculates that on average a monthly HUF 64,500 per employee will be paid out, so the total cost for three months could be HUF 193.6 billion (according to government calculations) or HUF 128 billion according to our (KOPINT-Tárki Institute) calculations. Additional criteria for eligibility-the employer must agree to keep headcount level until the end of the year in order to be considered for the subsidy:* the shortened work contract may not drop below 4 hours per day of working time * employers must organise a training for the employee in 30% of the hours that have been cut from working time and pay wages for this time as well. Applications open on 16 April, 2020 The measure was financed from the ESF and co-financed from the state budget. ","On 26 August 2020 the Ministry for Innovation and Technology (ITM) said that 226,000 employees had applied for the scheme. Earlier the ministry said indirectly it had reached 1.2 million people. The total number of employed in Hungary was 4,023,600 in 2019. Data show that around half of Hungary’s workforce is employed in jobs with high or medium vulnerability to being lost due to COVID-19. The government calculated that on average a monthly HUF 64,500 per employee would be paid out, so the total cost for 3 months could be HUF 193.6 billion, but in fact, only HUF 32 billion (€88.9 million) was spent. The central statistics office (KSH) said that by October 2020 the number of employees working reduced hours fell to 123,000 from 260,000 at the end of June, at the peak. Some 76,000 had their working hours reduced by 50% or more by October.The proportions of the types of supported companies were as follows:* 13% micro-enterprises* 25% small companies* 27.9% medium-sized companies* 33.8% large companies,With regard to sectors, the composition is the following:* manufacturing: 49.1% (nearly 100,000 applications);* trade and machinery: 16.7%, nearly 33,000 applications;* accommodation, hospitality: 9.1%, nearly 18,000 applications;* administrative activities and supporting services administration: 4.9% nearly 10,000 applications.Critics noted that the employer has attractive alternatives: dismissal, unpaid leave, or even citing the COVID-19 situation as a vis maior to pay no wages for down-time. Critics also argue that the measure came much too late, 5 weeks after Hungary announced a 'state of danger' for the pandemic on 11 March 2020.One analyst said that the measure is not enough to save ailing companies. The maximum amount of the subsidy is HUF 75,000 (€206) per month - this is the amount paid if working time is reduced by 4 hours a day – for a gross salary of HUF 322,000 (€883) or HUF 214,000 net (€587). In comparison, the average monthly gross salary was HUF 367,800 or €1,009 a month in 2019. By not firing an employee, the company saves only 2% on payroll costs, but since production declines and revenues fall, these savings disappear. The state, on the other hand, saves if employees are kept on, as the subsidy is less than the unemployment benefit it would have to pay if the employee was laid off. The state's share is about 30% at the average salary, the analysis published in G7.hu said.A national poll by Závecz Research said that a tenth of employees suffered big income losses already, 8% were sent on unpaid leave, 3% were laid off. 25% of employees polled feel they would be put on unpaid leave or fired in the coming months. Two-thirds of respondents feel COVID-19 will affect them financially and 80% of entrepreneurs said they would lose money in the pandemic. Some 2% of respondents started using up savings, and 4/10th postponed planned spending.",National government; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,Employer; European Funds; National funds,"In April the MKIK issued a statement proposing:* Raising the wage support scheme across all affected sectors and for all companies forced to shut down due to COVID-19 (especially for companies with revenues falling by more than 50%)* Longer unemployment benefit (currently at 3 months)* Sick pay raised to 100% of wages (from current 70%)* Support for starting new business* Boosting the public works programme* Support for robotisation in all industries* Incentives to encourage industrial investment and home construction* Preferential loans for exporting construction companies* Developing transport, especially cross-border transport in neighbouring countries with Hungarian communitiesThe trade union confederation LIGA said the government should do more as it does not help the thousands who had already been laid off. It also called for an extension of the measure, which both employer and employee sides think would be necessary.Trade union VDSZ: Measure was mainly used in the car industry, elsewhere raising working time banking was more popular. It was largely unsuccessful, it did not help protect jobs. They would propose to give an across-the-board subsidy to all workers in COVID-hit sectors. At a VKF meeting in early September 2020, employers put forward the proposal that the measure should be extended and should resemble more the German-type Kurzarbeit: The trade union Munkácstanácsok agrees with this proposal, that the government should pay 60% of the whole wage lost, rather than 70% of up to 50% lost as is the case now.MZTSZ trade union for the music industry: the measure was not used typically.",Bi-or tripartite social dialogue bodies,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/20200410/hogy-mukodik-majd-a-magyar-kurzarbeit-konkret-szamokat-mondott-az-allamtitkar-42545; https://magyarnemzet.hu/gazdasag/elegedettek-a-munkaadoi-kepviseletek-az-orban-tervvel-7980053/; http://www.liganet.hu/page/88/art/10490/akt/1/html/tovabbi-valsagkezelesi-intezkedesekre-van-szukseg.htm; https://merce.hu/2020/04/09/a-szakszervezetek-szerint-naponta-ezrek-veszitik-el-az-allasaikat-a-kormany-pedig-halogato-intezkedeseket-hoz/; https://ado.hu/munkaugyek/veszelyhelyzet-csokkentett-munkaidos-foglalkoztatas-es-elteresek-a-munka-torvenykonyvetol; https://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/20200420/bejelentettek-maris-nagy-konnyites-jon-a-magyar-bertamogatasi-rendszerben-427214; https://www.vg.hu/gazdasag/gazdasagi-hirek/maradt-forras-a-masodik-hullam-gazdasagi-kezelesere-2387360; http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/munkerohelyz/munkaidocsokk/index.htm

The goal is to protect people who lose their income because of the pandemic and cannot make debt repayments. Another goal is to keep lending activities afloat despite the crisis.","Every commercial loan, mortgage or other loan contract signed before 2020 March 18 will receive a freeze on loan repayments, capital repayment and any related fees until at least 31 December 2020 (can be extended). The length of the loan will be extended by the period of the freeze. The Banking Association said the interest on deferred loan payments would amount to about HUF 450 billion in the 9-month period, but our estimations based on partner interviews suggest it would be at most half of that amount. Clients must sign a statement (online) to opt out of the payment freeze scheme, so the default is that they do get the suspension. ","Hundreds of thousands of people or about 30-50% of credit clients have indicated to their banks until April 2020 that they would not avail of the payment freeze option and continue to make payments as before. The prediction of the National Bank of Hungary on the uptake was about 30% of all individual clients at the time. In its inflation report of June 2020, the National Bank of Hungary said that the loan suspension for individuals managed to serve its purpose of replacing lost income so that consumption could stay level or flatten out. Out of a total of about HUF 1,100 billion (€3.274 million) in household loan repayments eligible for the deferral, HUF 600 billion worth of repayments were requested for deferral under the scheme. The bank estimates that 50-70% of the amount freed in this way was spent towards consumption by households (private individuals). In March 2021, some 1.6 million individuals benefitted from the payment freeze. This amounted to HUF 4.2 billion or 42% of all loans (54% of retail loans). Analyses warned that many people who opted for the payment freeze and continue to stay in the scheme have not been sufficiently informed that in some cases this could mean that their loan will be extended not only be the time of the freeze period but, by many more months, even years. This is due to the fact that monthly repayments cannot be raised, but interest rates do rise during the period.

The norm establishes that these groups will not have to present these tax payments in April, as usual, but extends the term by one month until May 20 to mitigate the economic impact caused by the COVID-19 crisis.","The decree states that taxpayers (SMEs and self-employed) with a turnover of up to €600,000 will have until May 20 to file the tax returns for the month of April. In other words, they may postpone the filing of the quarterly VAT declaration, the fractional payment of corporation tax, as well as the personal income tax. In the case of domiciled declarations, the term is also extended by one month and goes from April 15 to May 15. Regardless of the time of submission, all charges will be made on May 20. That also includes statements filed before the 15th of this month.In this way, the Government shows its commitment to SMEs and the self-employed, who make up the bulk of the productive fabric of Spain. In fact, the measure approved today will benefit 3.4 million taxpayers, who represent 95% of companies and freelancers who must file their tax return in April. In practice, this moratorium represents liquidity of 3,558 million for SMEs and the self-employed.In addition, this measure aims to give tax managers and advisors a greater margin to collect the information necessary to comply with the tax obligations of their clients at a time of great difficulty due to the effects of the health emergency.This decision is part of the strategy of the Ministry of Finance to combat the effects of COVID-19 on the activity of self-employed and SMEs. In fact, the Government has already approved the possibility that both groups could postpone the payment of taxes to a maximum of €30,000 for six months, with three months without interest. This measure, with a maximum impact of 14,000 million, could benefit 99.8% of the self-employed and 94% of SMEs, which are those who are below this level of turnover.",No data available,National government,Self-employed,No special funding required,Employer organisations were supportive of this measure and asked to extend it beyond the initial deadline.,No involvement,No involvement,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4448

The aim of the measure is to allow the employer to make flexible changes in work conditions rather than lay off workers in the adverse economic climate of the COVID-19 pandemic.","The measure applies to all employees working under the legal status regulated by the Labour Code (Act. 1/2012). The employer can change working arrangements, for example order remote work unilaterally. The employer may carry out any measures necessary to ensure the worker’s health and safety during the pandemic. The employer and the employee can make any new arrangement by agreement even if it contradicts the provisions of the Labour Code. Some of the more important issues experienced by workers during the COVID crisis are the options available to the employer for sending employees home and paying reduced wages or none at all. In human services-heavy sectors where work has become impossible, unpaid leave or ""standby"" status are common. ","Four trade union confederations have complained in a joint call that the measure creates new kinds of “dependencies” for the worker, as the employer has gained too much flexibility in the arrangement of working conditions. By temporarily suspending the protections laid down in the Labour Code, the measure puts disproportionate burdens on employees which should not be the aim of this regulation, they said.These four trade union confederations are as follows:1. Liga - Democratic League of Independent Trade Unions 2. ÉSZT - Trade Union of Professionals 3. MASZ - Hungarian Trade Union Confederation4. SZEF - Trade Unions' Forum for Cooperation ",National government; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,Employees; Employer,"Social partners were not consulted, but trade union confederations have signed a joint statement protesting this new measure, arguing that it is putting too much of the economic burden suffered from COVID-19 on employees. In July 2020, LIGA trade union confederation said teleworking and remote work should be regulated as part of the Labour Code and they should apply for all kinds of telework, not just computer-based ones. They did not agree that work from home should be unilaterally ordered by the employer and would also set a higher limit for the monthly compensation payable. The new regulations published in November did not meet unions' expectations, they want to make monthly compensation compulsory. The VDSZ trade union said the biggest problem was that rules about telework and remote work overlap and are confusing. VDSZ repeated its calls in March 2021 for support for parents who stay at home because of school lockdowns. Under current temporary regulations, parents can stay at home if the employer agrees, but no compensation is paid. Holidays can be taken but only at the expense of their regular holidays.",No involvement,Informed,No,Only private sector,,No,,,http://www.szakszervezet.net/hu/2014-04-03-13-35-01/1407-koronavirus-kozos-nyilatkozat-a-munkavallalokkal-is-szolidaris-intezkedesek-szuksegesek; https://www.pwc.com/hu/hu/sajtoszoba/2020/uj_rendelet_szabalyozza_a_veszelyhelyzet_alatti_tavmunkavegzest.html; https://merce.hu/2020/11/12/a-vegyipari-szakszervezetek-szerint-kesz-atveres-az-uj-tavmunka-rendelet/; https://magyarnarancs.hu/belpol/home-office-a-kormany-szerint-eleg-a-mostani-szabalyozas-234303; https://nepszava.hu/3113283_ingovanyos-talaj-a-home-offic

The Hardship Fund will provide council tax relief to help those affected most by coronavirus. The funding will go to local authorities in England to enable them to reduce the 2020 to 2021 council tax bills of working age people receiving Local Council Tax Support. Councils will also be able to use the funding to provide further discretionary support to vulnerable people through other support arrangements such as Local Welfare Schemes.Guidance for the GBP 500 million Hardship Fund was released on the 24th of March, aimed at providing clarity to local authorities on how to allocate the funding following its announcement at Budget.This amends s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.","In the Guidance issued, the Government states that it recognises that COVID-19 is likely to cause fluctuations in household incomes and that, as a result, some individuals may struggle to meet council tax payments. It says that councils will already have established their local council tax support schemes for 2020-21 and that the Government therefore expects that billing authorities will primarily use their grant allocation to reduce the council tax liability of individuals in their area, using their discretionary powers under s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. Further, it states that councils may also want to use some funding to deliver increased financial assistance through other local support mechanisms, having considered local circumstances.The Government states that councils should expedite provision of support to individuals in their area, using existing policies and schemes to deliver assistance where practical. Where council clearance processes are considered necessary, to avoid delays, they should be kept as light touch as possible within the governance arrangements of each authority.It also states that council tax reductions should be applied as soon as possible from the beginning of the 2020-21 financial year and billing authorities should rebill council taxpayers as quickly as practical. Authorities will want to make the local population aware of how the grant support package will be delivered, e.g. through providing information on their websites.The Government confirms that it will fund billing authorities in full for the new burdens cost for delivering the support.  Local authorities will wish to maintain a record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms.","On the 16th of April, the UK Government issued more guidance, in which it stated that all working-age Local Council Tax Support (LCTS) claimants in 2020-21 (who are entitled to working-age LCTS in respect of any part of the 2020-21 council tax liability) will receive a further discount of GBP 150 under the Hardship Fund.

However, as many might not be able to work as usual or might even lose their jobs, the removal of the income ceiling will likely not affect all students.",National government,Unemployed; Youth (18-25); Workers in essential services,National funds,N/A,Unknown,Informed,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/03/crisis-package-for-jobs-and-transition/; https://www.csn.se/languages/english/information-about-the-corona-virus.html; https://csn.se/languages/english/information-about-the-corona-virus.html#h-Ifyouhaveincometheincomelimithasbeenremovedduring2021; https://www.government.se/information-material/2021/06/key-acts-and-ordinances-entering-into-force-around-the-second-half-of-2021/

Rental leases for these companies cannot be terminated in this period, either, so tenants cannot be evicted, although it is not clear if this means on any grounds at all or whether landlords can exercise some of their rights to terminate.","Under Section 3 of government decree 47/2020, the sectors selected as one most affected by the COVID-19 crisis will receive protection from rent increase or rental contract termination. The measure applies to sectors where businesses typically rent rather than own their premises and where the economic impacts of COVID-19 have caused financial strains. Although the measure does not specify if rental contracts are banned from termination even if no rent is paid by the tenant at all, experts agree that with the eviction ban in place, tenants are likely to get away with not paying at all during the 'state of emergency' period while their business is likely to be closed down.","The measure could affect about 50,000 companies, mainly SMEs in the COVID-vulnerable sectors. The rule overrides any rent increases stipulated in the rental contract. Legal experts say that if tenants do not pay rent at all, landlords are likely to seek agreement on special terms rather than lose clients on a shrinking property rental market.

The measure aims at preventing job losses in areas of innovation and product development due to COVID-19.,"The employee can apply for the subsidy for a duration of three months no later than 30 days after the end of the state of emergency or 31 December 2020.

Old-age pensioners with qualifications were regarded as a target group.

The regulation suspends some of the public pension scheme rules on specified terms for a limited period. ,"The current rules on the reduction and termination of pensions in connection with employment income are clear and absolute in their form, so that any exceptions in general should be limited and well justified. In a pandemic situation, the overall purpose is that the public health service maintains necessary health care. In order to realize this purpose, the Ministry proposes that income from voluntary work in public health services or with private persons who, according to law or agreement, offer health services to the population, should not, however, result in a reduction or loss of pension. To prevent pension reduction for health professionals taking on extra work during the crisis connected to COVID-19, amendments to three pension scheme regulations were passed.

The tax value of losses in 2020 will be paid to the companies at the tax settlement in 2021.

In this way, the measure reinforces the tax system's stabilizing role and ability to curb the decline. The Government proposes that an amount limit of NOK 30 million will be set for the amount of deficit in 2020 that can be reversed against previous profits. The relatively high amount of money means that most profitable small and medium-sized companies with a deficit in 2020 can take full advantage of the scheme. The amount limit is necessary to have some control over how large a loss of proceeds the scheme may entail.

The measure is expected to have little impact on the volume of flights. However, the measure is intended as a temporary relief for the airlines during the outbreak of the coronavirus. The purpose of the tax is primarily to provide the state with revenue, but the tax can have an environmental impact by reducing the demand for flights. The Ministry points out that tourism in general and aviation in particular are severely affected by the virus outbreak. Maintaining a fiscal charge on air travel can help exacerbate the negative financial consequences of the virus outbreak.","The duty to pay air passenger tax is incurred when the flight starts from a Norwegian airport, and the fee is calculated per passenger who commences taxable flight from a Norwegian airport. The cancellation of the tax in the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 October 2020 means that the tax will be abolished both for flights made earlier this year and for flights commenced in the period up to and including 31 October 2020. The time of purchase of the air ticket is of no significance for the duty to pay. Flights starting on or after 1 November 2020 will be subject to tax.

The amendment to the lay-off regulation reduce the cost for employers and increase the unemployment benefit for the unemployed.

The unemployment benefit starts when the unemployed person has been unemployed and has been registered as a real job seeker for at least three of the last fifteen days. These three days constitute the waiting period in the unemployment benefit scheme. To reduce the burden on workers the waiting time is removed for the laid off.The temporarily dismissed are guaranteed 100% salary up to 6G (approx. €50,700) from day 3, when employer is exempted from paying wage, through day 20.

The Regional Labor Market Councils (RAR) and the Danish Agency for Labor Market and Recruitment (START) have therefore implemented this COVID-19 'Job-VET-model' for retaining employees through remote learning. The remote learning programs provide companies with more opportunities to retain their own employees in a situation where many companies are experiencing a downturn in business. In addition, companies have the opportunity to compensate for wage losses through ""VEU/SVU-allowance"". In addition, there are opportunities to obtain grants from other sources, such as any competency funds, etc.The model was first launched in the service, tourism, hotel and restoration industries, and then the construction and offshore industries were added. At the same time, several other industries are on their way to be included in the model.","The 'Job-VET-model' consists of four stages: 1. The needs of the labor market2. Agreement between the social partners and specification of professional content3. Preparation of project plan4. Selection of education provider and online learning programThe model assumes that the social partners, educational institutions and The Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment jointly put together a VET-program (online) that targets specific industries. For example, it may be competencies targeted to sales and service within the restaurant industry.Companies receive up to 100% of their wage costs, while employees participate in distance education.

The measure was designed to make working arrangements more flexible for the employer to help protect jobs in companies where business has shut down or work reduced due to the pandemic.","The new measure states that the rules of the Labour Code capping the working time banking period at 4 months (or 6 months in some professions) will now not apply. The Labour Code (modified in late 2018) earlier allowed the working time banking frame to be raised to 36 months only by collective agreement. Now employers can use this method of working time arrangement for up to 24 months without signing/modifying a collective agreement. This means that an employer who is unable to give work to the employee during the pandemic period will continue to pay full wages, but can order extended working hours to make up for the loss when business returns to normal.","There are about 50 companies known to have taken advantage of this measure and extended working time banking due to COVID-19 in the first phase. These include 42 electronics, metal, machinery and car manufacturers. The Vasas union noted that this means in some places when business returns to normal after the pandemic slowdown, working time could grow to 10-12 hours a day, with no paid overtime and workers could only have on Sunday off in a month. Vasas was only able to be involved in negotiations about working time banking changes at one company, as trade union involvement, by the new law, is not compulsory. The trade union VDSZ said the measure was used mainly by the auto industry. They were involved in talks at 6 companies.",National government; Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,Companies,"Trade unions widely protested this measure, saying that it could “tie” the employee to the company for two years, if work not available now would have to be made up for in coming years. The MASZSZ union confederation recommended using the working time banking system until 31 December 2020 only. The union said the measure would not prevent any job cuts. A MASZSZ official called it an “extension of the ‘slave laws’ adopted last year” by tying the employee to the employer, which they believe is against EU norms. The Vasas trade union said the government had put the burdens of COVID-19 entirely on the employee side. MGYOSZ, a large EO, said the measure is likely to have only helped some companies and its real contribution to job retention is unknown.Trade unions widely protested this measure, saying that it could “tie” the employee to the company for two years, if work not available now would have to be made up for in coming years.

The government has set up a dedicated site where the companies can apply for grant to cover fixed and unavoidable costs.

Companies instructed by the state to shut down to prevent spread of COVID-19 virus will be able to apply for compensation of up to 90% of their unavoidable fixed costs in the specified months, calculated as follows: reduction in turnover x unavoidable fixed costs x 90 percent adjustment factor. 2. Firms that are not required to shut down, but still experiencing a reduction in turnover of 30% or more (20% in March), will have to pay an excess.

In general, the short-time work scheme entails that during the period of partial activity :* The employer receives from the public authorities (Services and Payment Agency - ASP) an allowance equivalent to a share of the hourly pay of the employee placed in partial activity;* The employee receives a partial activity allowance from the employer in lieu of salary for the period during which the employee is placed in partial activity. This text sets out the methods for calculating the allowance paid to the employer and benefit paid to workers. These new rules allow for the coverage of: employees with an annual working time account (forfaits jours) in days or hours - i.e. employees whose working hours cannot be fixed in advance (often managers); civil aviation crews, freelance journalists (who are paid for each article ordered); salespeople with the status of sales representatives (VRP); home-based employees paid on a piecework basis; intermittent entertainment workers and models.

This decree is applicable to short-time compensation claims submitted from 12 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. For the two main categories of workers covered, the rules are the following:1. Employees with a ""forfait jours"" in hours and daysFor employees whose working hours are fixed by a 'forfait-jours"" agreement in hours or days over the year, both the allowance and the short-time work allowance are determined by taking into account the number of hours or days or half-days not worked by the employee. The number of hours taken into account is determined by converting a number of days or half-days into hours according to the following flat-rate periods:* a half-day not worked corresponds to 3.5 hours not worked;* a day not worked corresponds to 7 hours not worked;* a week not worked corresponds to 35 hours not worked.Days of paid leave and rest taken during the period of suspension or reduction of activity, as well as public holidays not worked which correspond to working days, are converted into hours according to the same procedures.2. Civil aviation flight crewIn the case of civil aviation flight crews, whose working hours are organised in the form of alternating days of activity and days of inactivity, the number of hours giving rise to the payment of the allowance and the partial activity allowance shall be determined on the basis of a number of eligible days of inactivity. The latter is determined by taking into account the difference between the number of days of inactivity recorded and the number of days of inactivity normally guaranteed to the employee over the period in question.

The agreement covers the following issues: telework, full time arranged activity, short-time work, ""fourteen"" and work stoppage. All the measures will apply for the period from 16 March to 30 April 2020, 'possibly with retroactive effect for this period, depending on the situations already in place'.","The main subjects addressed by the agreement are:1. **Use of teleworking**On a temporary basis and depending on the activity and the technological possibilities available, Daher has set up teleworking ""for a maximum number of group employees whenever possible"". It is up to the manager to regularly assess the workload and the ability of each individual to telework. The manager regularly informs the employee of his or her continued teleworking, or of the possibility of returning to the site ""for service requirements that cannot be carried out remotely"", or of being partially teleworking.2. **Adaptation of work organisation**In some sectors of the company, the work organisation had to be adapted in order to comply with the instructions for taking up work at the post (cleaning, extended or moved lunch break, etc.). In the context of this ""adjusted full-time activity"", the company undertakes, despite a potential reduction in working hours, to maintain employee remuneration, including team bonuses, basket bonuses, meal vouchers or equivalent meal allowance in the absence of closed collective catering, etc. Moreover, ""as a completely exceptional measure and to take into account the commitment of the employees"", the hours not worked due to these adjusted schedules will not give rise to any recuperation.3. **Organisation of short-time working**""In accordance with government directives known to date"", ""alternative systems"" to be used before the implementation of the partial activity system are identified in each company. As part of the agreement, and ""subject to the approval of the administration"", the equivalent of a seven-hour day taken as ""time bank/flexible/ reduced working hours (RTT)"" for non-management employees. For managers, one day of RTT (two for metalworking managers) is taken on a mandatory basis. In addition, the agreement continues, the setting of five working days of paid leave over the period of the agreement is imposed.4. **Remuneration during short-time working**In an approach aimed at preserving purchasing power, Daher raises the remuneration of employees on short-time working to 95% of their net salary, ""instead of the 84% of net salary provided for by law"". In return for this matching contribution and in solidarity with employees whose activity will have been maintained, employees in partial employment will, before December 31, 2020, and as soon as the confinement period has ended, perform up to 25 hours of activity for non-managers and three days for managers, for each full month of partial unemployment. 5. **The ""fourteen-week"" period**In the event that, for safety or health reasons, the employee is sent home at the initiative of the employer or at the request of the client, it is up to the company to find a solution to temporarily offer him/her another assignment or to transfer him/her to another status.For the employee who wishes to take up an assignment at his own initiative ""in a fortnight"" and whose situation is not recognised by the health insurance fund, the company ""shows adaptation and kindness"" to enable him to use as far as possible any other more advantageous arrangement in terms of maintaining remuneration (paid leave, RTT, time bank, flexible, etc.).6. **Work stoppage**In the event of a work stoppage (illness, childcare, population at risk at COVID-19, maternity, etc.), the employee benefits from the compensation scheme provided for, via the daily social security benefits and the employer's supplement set according to the Daher Group.

The agreement provides that they may be reduced by up to 50% of the theoretical workforce, with a minimum of two employees per sector. Over the period, the management must draw up a provisional schedule for the composition of the teams, ensuring that there are rotations between employees. In the event of an unforeseen additional absence, one or more employees may be called in to complete the team. In any event, the provisional schedule is adapted on a daily basis to take into account any changes in the situation.The employees affected by this reduction in activity shall not suffer any loss of remuneration and shall be paid at the normal time, 'as if they had worked full time according to their usual working hours'. In other words, the agreement specifies that the rest days imposed on certain employees will be considered as actual working time for the calculation of remuneration elements.In addition, to limit physical contact, the agreement provides that employees travelling to the sites may travel with their personal vehicle. These trips are financed by the company in the form of mileage allowance payments on the June 2020 payroll at the latest.  All STMicroelectronics employees other than Manufacturing and Production Support who travel to their place of work at the request of their management are also eligible for this measure.Finally, a systematic temperature reading can be taken at the entrance to the sites. In the event that the temperature exceeds a limit set by the central health, safety and working conditions commission (CSSCT) and the occupational physician coordinating France, employees are invited to go home and consult their treating physician or log on to the health insurance website to obtain a work stoppage.","The agreement applies to production workers of STMicroelectronics which employs about 10,100 people in France.

The metallurgy agreement on work organisation to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic was signed by the UIMM and the CFDT, CFE-CGC and FO trade union federations.","The agreement stresses, in its preamble, that the COVID-19 epidemic and the measures taken by the public authorities to limit its spread have serious consequences for metalworking companies. But it also underlines the right of everyone to preserve their health and to work safely. Faced with contradictory demands, the signatories call for an appropriate social dialogue in companies. They add that they would like company negotiations to be favoured so that the branch agreement plays exclusively its supplementary role, in accordance with the Labour Code. The agreement of 3 April 2020 does not therefore call into question the company agreements already signed, nor the company negotiations currently underway.*Short-time working*The agreement invites companies to 'seek with the social partners, beyond the preservation of employment, a change in the conditions of compensation' for short-time working, 'to mitigate its negative impacts' (on the purchasing power of employees).The agreement recalls that the period of short-time working can be used for training actions. It adds that when occupational health and safety conditions are ""irreproachable, guaranteed and applied"", the training action can be implemented ""in situ"", within the company, if necessary, in a work situation. In this context, the joint body in charge of vocational training (OPCO 2i) is invited to provide collective training actions for employees of VSEs and SMEs. ""The signatories thus wish to gradually prepare, under the best conditions, the return to normal activity».*Exceptional management of paid leave*The agreement opens up the possibility for the employer to set or change the date for taking six working days of paid leave per employee. This possibility will be open as soon as the agreement is tabled and will end on October 31, 2020. It may result in the taking of leave in advance of the period during which it is normally intended to be taken.The employer must respect an order of priority. The employer chooses:* first, the taking of paid leave earned during the previous accrual period;* then, the taking of conventional days earned (seniority leave, in particular);* lastly, the taking of paid leave acquired during the last vesting period, which may lead to early taking.The employer must respect a period of notice, set at two working days during the confinement period and five days thereafter. The leave period chosen by the employer ends on October 31, 2020.","The agreement covers all workers of the metal industry, about 1.4 million employees.",Social partners jointly,Employees in standard employment,Companies; National funds,"In the framework of the Bipartite National committee of employment of the Metal sector (CPNE), social partners have signed a sectoral collective agreement to cope with the COVID-19 crisis.",Bi-or tripartite social dialogue bodies,Agreed (outcome),Yes,Only private sector,"C24 Manufacture of basic metals; C25 Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment; C26 Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products; C27 Manufacture of electrical equipment; C28 Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.; C29 Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers",No,,,https://www.metallurgie-cfecgc.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/Accord%20national%20du%203%20avril%202020%20portant%20sur%20les%20modalités%20d%27organisation%20du%20travail%20pour%20faire%20face%20à%20l%27épidémie%20de%20covid-19%20-%20signé.pdf

It targets enterprises in the horti- and agricultural sectors as a whole because this sector was one of the first to feel a marked hit from the crisis. This includes the provision of food and other grown products, not just for domestic consumption but also for trade. The seasonality of work in this sector and the timing of the COVID-19 crisis seem to have led to this group of enterprises receiving specific support.","The sectors covered here by this measure include the agriculture and horticulture sector, the fisheries sector, and the aquaculture sector. These sectors are all confronted by an international and domestic decrease in demand for their produce.The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit - LNV), will therefore temporarily underwrite working capital granted to farms and horticultural companies under the the Guarantee for Agricultural SME Credit, (Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten), which is part of the Guarantee SME Loans scheme for small and medium-sized farms and enterprises.In this way, the government will act as a guarantor for loans granted to farms. The government seeks to ensure that the scope of this scheme will be broadened in the short term. Enterprises can seek credit to bridge their troubled times of up to €15 million, for which the Ministry of LNV will act as guarantor for up to 70%.

More specifically, this measure is aimed at taking over the wage costs so that enterprise do not get bankrupted and that employees get an income. This applies to workers with permanent as well as flexible or temporary contracts. The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) till the pandemic is under control.This measure is part of the third package of emergency measures to deal with the corona virus. This was a package of several measures which have been taken to combat the COVID-19 and its effects announced and will be announced on 1 October 2020.The current NOW 2.0 will be come to an end by the end of September 2020. Under the third package of emergency corona measures, the NOW will be extended in a third version, NOW 3.0, from 1 October 2020 to 31 June 2021. The rationale behind this extension is that the corona crisis and its impacts will be felt in Dutch society and industry for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the NOW 3.0 will run for longer than its forerunners, but will also offer more limited support.","The aim is to help enterprises to pay the salaries of their employees so that employment as well as business viability can be maintained as much as possible.The period for the NOW 3.0 is divided into three slots of three months, where per slot, the eligibility criteria become more stringent. In the first three months an enterprise is eligible for support if their revenue has declined by 20%.In the second three month slot (as of 1 January 2021), enterprises are eligible if their revenue has declined by 30%. The proportion of revenue loss for the third slot is not yet known (as the third package of emergency measures has not yet been rolled out).The support which is provided under the NOW 3.0 will also gradually be reduced though it is not yet clear how.Within NOW 1.0 and 2.0, the financial aid available for those enterprises which suffered a revenue loss of more than 20%. The government subsidised up to 90% of the wage costs of staff for a period of up to three months. Within NOW 3.0, during the first three months the maximum level of support is 80% of wage costs, 70% in the second slot, and 60% in the third slot of three months.This applies to workers on permanent contracts as well as flexible contracts (including zero hour ""nul uren"" contracts, or on call contracts ""oproep contracten""). However, in return enterprises may not fire anyone (fixed and flexible employment contracts alike), for economic reasons during the period of time covered by the allowance.  ","For NOW 1.0, for which data covers the period from 5 April to 5 July, 148,355 applications were received for financing, of which 139,399 were granted. This supported 2,653,041 workers at enterprises.For NOW 2.0, for which data covers the period of 6 July to 4 September, 65,129 applications were received and 63.088 granted. This helped to support 1,332,904 workers at enterprises.A total of 81,000 employer’s have applied for subsidies in the fourth quarter of 2020 (NOW 3.0). The NOW (Temporary emergency scheme for job retention) measure in practiceThere are nearly 140,000 companies that have used the NOW-1 measure. That is about 6.5 percent of all companies in the Netherlands. Especially companies with 10 to 50 employees make use of this measure. At sector level, the hospitality industry has by far made the most use of this measure. In this sector, 34 percent of the hospitality industry used the NOW-1 measure. Almost all of the hospitality companies with 10 or more employees made use of this measure (Bedrijvenbeleid in beeld, 2021)..There are approximately 64,000 companies that have benefited from the NOW-2 scheme. That is about three percent of all companies in the Netherlands. Especially companies with 10 to 50 employees use the NOW-2, as was already the case with the NOW-1. At sector level, the hospitality industry makes the most use of this by far, just as with the NOW-1. In this sector, more than sixteen percent of the hospitality companies made use of the NOW-2 scheme (Bedrijvenbeleid in beeld, 2021). There are approximately 78,000 companies that have used the NOW-3.1. That is about four percent of all companies in the Netherlands. Especially companies with 10 to 50 employees make use of this scheme, just as with the predecessors. The hospitality industry also makes the most use of this by far. In this sector, 28 percent of the catering companies used the NOW-3.1(Bedrijvenbeleid in beeld,2021).NOW 3.2: On reference date 31 May 2021: almost 76,000 companies; 3.5% of all companies in the Netherlands and comparable to the use of NOW 3.1. Especially companies with 10 to 50 employees. By sector, mainly catering: 1 in 4 catering companies, of which almost all catering establishments employ more than 250 people.NOW 3.3: Since 31 May 2021, the reference date for this monitoring, not all applications could be included yet. At that time there were almost 24,000 companies with a NOW 3.3. That is 1% of all companies in the Netherlands. It is also the catering companies that make the most use of this scheme.Weakness of the measureThe UWV, which implements the NOW scheme, deals with possible manipulation of the turnover and the wage bill. The benefits agency also receives reports of identity fraud. In 2020, the subsidy was (temporarily) discontinued in eleven cases (Financieel Dagblad, 2021a).Last year, the Court of Audit warned that the design of the aid scheme could lead to errors and misuse. Without extensive checks, the UWV pays an advance of 80% based on estimated loss of turnover and only settles at a much later stage, based on definitive figures on turnover and wage bill. Companies then receive the remaining 10% of the subsidy, but if it turns out that the turnover was higher or the wage bill was lower than anticipated, they must return all or part of the money (Financieel Dagblad, 2021a).The nearly €40 billion in aid that the government has pumped into the business community since March is surprisingly well-suited given its broad and rather 'blind' nature. That conclusion can at least be drawn from the first study into the effectiveness of corona support by economists at Rabobank and Utrecht University (Financieel Dagblad, 2021b).According to some economists, the aid is a waste of money because it is scattered so widely that many unhealthy businesses can survive. They thus form a block to the rest of the economy. The researchers have not seen any of this so far, which is in line with the findings of research conducted in Denmark (Financieel Dagblad, 2021b).",National government; Local / regional government; Public employment service,,National funds,"(As with the other measures (and consequently, the other cases): Though not discussed in great detail, the social partners (national level trade unions and employer organisations), have come together to discuss with the government how best to tackle the effects of the corona virus on workers and employers so as to keep the Dutch economy going.

VNO-NCW and MKB-Nederland are happy that employers will not be fined anymore for firing employees. In the initial policy proposal the compensation would be cutback after January 2021, the employer’s organisations were critical of this.

NL-2020-40/761,Temporary subsidy for self-employed ,Tijdelijke Overbruggingsregeling Zelfstandige Ondernemers (Tozo) ,Netherlands,Applies nationwide,10/01/2020,09/30/2021,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,New aspects included into existing measure,Income protection beyond short-time work,Extensions of  income support to workers not covered by any kind of protection scheme,04/21/2020,"This measure has been introduced as emergency measures specifically to combat or cushion the effects of the corona crisis. Specifically, this measure is aimed at providing self-employed a minimum income to live from. The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning and to maintain the well-being of solo self-employed.There have been several forms to this measure. Tozo 1.0 was implemented in March 2020 and three months later, this emergency measure was renewed, as of June 2020 as Tozo 2.0. Tozo 2.0 measure will come to an end at the end of September 2020 and the new measure will run from 1 October 2020 to 31 June 2021. The aim of the measure remains unchanged, namely to support solo self-employed individuals financially to help them maintain their liquidity and to supplement their incomes. This version of the measure is divided into periods of three months, to slowly reduce the scope of the measure in the interest of sustainability. As time progresses only the most dramatically hit or vulnerable solo self-employed will be eligible for support. The municipal governments implement this national measure. ","The Tozo 3.0 is one of these measures to be extended in the third package of emergency measures. It will continue to work in much the same way with some adjustments, namely supplementing the lost income of solo self-employed and also offering business loan to participants at low interest rates. The measure was designed to be broad and to help as many solo self-employed as possible and for this reason it is a relatively straight forward measure.The Tozo 3.0 includes an income assessment to judge whether a solo-self-employed person is eligible for the measure (which already existed in the previous version of the measure), an assessment of capital will also be added as of April 2021. This assessment will check for the assets and capital (including bank accounts, saving accounts, cars, shares, obligations etc.), held by the entrepreneur in question. Entrepreneurs with over  €45,520 in total capital will not eligible for the measure.The working of the measure remains the same: * The municipal governments supplement income up to this level, or up to the amount of €1,050 for a single person and up to €1,500 for a couple. * The other option is for the entrepreneur to take out a loan of up to around €10,000 as capital for the enterprise. This loan can be paid back within three years at an interest rate of 2%. The eligibility criteria are based on being self-employed (working at least 1,225 hours a year or 23.5 hours a week), while the solo-enterprise must have been active before the COVID-19 crisis and the TOZO came into effect, before 17 March 2020.","Establishing the use for the TOZO measure is more difficult than for nationally implemented measures as the TOZO is implemented by the 355 municipal governments in the Netherlands. Data on the use takes longer to collect as a result. The most recent, preliminary data, received from municipalities and analysed by the NSO, Statistics Netherlands, shows that until June 2020, approximately 100,010 people made use of the TOZO income support.Self-employed persons in a service profession made the most use of the TOZO measure (38 percent), followed by the self-employed in a creative or linguistic profession (34 percent). The former mainly concerned cooks, hairdressers and bar staff, of whom about half made use of this measure. The creative professions include visual and performing artists and photographers and interior designers. In addition, the proportion of self-employed persons that TOZO applied for was also high among entrepreneurs in the transport and logistics professions. In the professional group drivers (taxi) and the like, 6 out of 10 self-employed persons made use of this measure.Incidentally, there is a strong correlation between the decrease in the number of hours worked by self-employed persons and the number of requests to use the TOZO measure. The decline in the number of hours worked in service professions was greatest among the self-employed, 22 hours per week, and the TOZO was most often claimed in such professions. And vice versa: this entitlement was also lowest among self-employed persons who worked little or no fewer hours in April, such as agricultural professions and professions in public administration.The process to TOZO: commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, a process evaluation was carried out into the realization of the TOZO. Three success factors have been described in the evaluation of this process. Firstly, there is much appreciation for the fact that stakeholders are involved at a very early stage. The most relevant stakeholders were involved from the start. All parties involved were aware of the social task they faced and the need to solve this problem together. The involvement of stakeholders has also provided support for the TOZO. Second, the collaboration has been predominantly constructive. Good use has been made of everyone's expertise and the predominant image is that there was room for everyone's perspective. Those involved felt that they were heard and everyone's input was included in the development of TOZO and the developed products. Third, the right people were represented in the project organization. However, this study shows that the collaboration has changed over time. Once TOZO 1 was developed and the first supporting products delivered, the sense of urgency waned. In addition, after a while difficult subjects came up on the agenda, in which there was less of a shared interest, but more of conflicting interests. The parties involved were less unanimous on a number of subjects, in particular when it came to lawfulness issues and implementation costs.",National government; Social partners jointly; Local / regional government,Solo-self-employed; One person or microenterprises,National funds,"Sources indicate that the social partners were involved in the design of this measure, together with the national and municipal governments. However, the exact nature of the involvement is not clear. As a rule, Dutch policymaking often involves consultation with relevant social partners for a given sector or field, to discuss the main challenges in a given policy area and the expected effects of a policy intervention. In this case an organisation, Divosa, comprised of municipal government directors active in social policy domains, were involved in developing the measure.The peak level social partners, as well as organisations such as Divosa and the VNG, have been deeply involved in the process of designing the extension of this measure. Overall social partner are pleased with the new package of measures, including this one, the TOZO 3.0.The TOZO 3.0 initially included a proposal for a means-test on liquid assets. In a letter to the Minister of Social Affairs the four main representatives of self-employed professionals argued that they opposed this proposal and would like to see it removed, which was eventually done by the government. ZZP Nederland has also specifically demanded that partner income is not taken into consideration when determining whether self-employed professionals are eligible for income support.

This is part of the package of national measures taken to mitigate effects of COVID-19.It should be noted that as of April 2020, Parliament and First Chamber have agreed to the package of bills, though in this situation the cabinet did not need to formally wait for agreement in order to enact the measures.It has been introduced as bunch of emergency solutions specifically to combat or cushion the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. The measure is for 3 months, but there is budget available to extend it for other 3 months. More specifically this measure is aimed at providing the enterprise with budget to pay their costs. The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) till the pandemic is under control.","The subsidy for enterprises in affected sectors, or Tegemoetkoming Ondernemers Getroffen Sectoren (TOGS) is a government allowance for enterprises that are directly negatively affected by the government’s COVID-19 measures. These enterprises are eligible to receive a one-time government subsidy of €4,000, and in general consist of businesses that are directly, negatively affected by the government’s measures. This includes enterprises that were forced to close doors or could not operate fully because of the government’s corona measures.The main selection criteria is SBI codes, the Dutch equivalent of NACE codes. Currently this includes more sectors and sub-sectors than can be noted down here. The sectors included is adapted regularly, by the Ministry since also enterprises that were not obliged to close doors were hit hard such as small fashion shop, so these enterprises were included at a later stage and the ministry announced that the list is not complete yet (13 April 2020). Indeed, this list seems to be evolving and expanding as the crisis continues and future prognoses start to be developed.","RVO has granted a TOGS application to almost 216,000 companies (as at 30 September 2020). This mainly concerns small businesses. About half of these are companies with one workplace. For 93% these were companies with fewer than ten workplaces. Hospitality entrepreneurs in particular have made use of this scheme (Bedrijvenbeleid in beeld, 2021).The RVO also uses NACE codes for this measure. Tens of thousands of entrepreneurs reported that their NACE code was missing. The government used these signals for the expansions and the rectification. On May 13, the list of established NACE codes was expanded again. As a result, companies could still apply for the TOGS after the 2nd expansion on 13 May with the code of their ancillary activity (RVO, 2020).",National government,Sector specific set of companies,National funds,"Though not discussed in great detail, the social partners (national level trade unions and employer organisations), have come together to discuss with the government how best to tackle the effects of the corona virus on workers and employers so as to keep the Dutch economy going.

However, the cultural and creative sector, especially badly hit, expressed concern that more was needed for its support. Museums, cultural institutes, events, performances and performers voiced concerns that the crisis could mean that many would have to close their doors for good. Beyond the fact that many people simply cannot attend events, performances, of cultural institutes and this meaning a loss of income, there is also a seasonality to the sector (with many events taking place in the spring and summer).

Instead of submitting their accounts on 1 April, they may now do so by 1 June 2020 instead.* Subsidies to cultural institutes will be paid out by the government and there is an easing of the rule that subsidies are reduced if planned performance targets are not met by the institutes. This also applies to subsidies to specific projects and initiatives; subsidies will still be paid even if certain planned targets are not met.

As part of these measures, the Revenue service operates a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The scheme enables employees whose employers are affected by the pandemic to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system. The scheme is expected to last 12 weeks from 26 March 2020.The scheme was introduced as part of the terms of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020.On Wednesday 15 April, the Minister for Finance announced further updates to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The scheme was closed on the 31 of August and replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) read more on the [COVID-19 data base website](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/IE-2020-36_1157.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19)","The Scheme is available to employers from all sectors (excluding the public service and non-commercial semi-state sector) whose business activities are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.It is open to employers who retain staff on payroll; some of the staff may be temporarily not working or some may be on reduced hours and/or reduced pay. Provided the employer meets certain conditions and, subject to the levels of pay made to employees, the employer may be eligible for the scheme for some, or all of its employees.The employer includes the subsidy as part of the employees’ wages in addition to any amount that the employer would otherwise be able to pay. The subsidy element on the employee’s payslip is indicated as a payment described as 'GovCov19 WageSub'.  * A subsidy of 85% is payable for employees whose net weekly income does not exceed €412. * A subsidy of 70% is payable for those whose net weekly pay was previously no more than €500 but less than €586, with a cap of €410.To qualify for the Scheme, employers must be experiencing significant negative economic disruption due to COVID-19, be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Revenue, a minimum of a 25% decline in turnover and be unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully. They must also retain their employees on the payroll.The scheme is confined to employees who were on the employer’s payroll as at 29 February 2020, and for whom a payroll submission was made to Revenue in the period from 1 February 2020 to 15 March 2020.","47,400 employers are registered with Revenue for the scheme.According to the minister responsible, on 29 April 2020, 'The cumulative value of payments made to employers under the scheme is €652 million, almost 400,000 employees have now received at least one payment under the scheme'. According to preliminary statistics from the Irish Revenue, to 21 May:  * Over 55,500 employers registered with Revenue for the wage subsidy scheme.* Over 48,300 employers have already received subsidy payments.* Over 473,500 employees have already received at least one payment.Up to 5 June 2020, over 58,300 employers had registered for the TWSS and over €1.37 billion had been paid out. The scheme has supported over 514,700 employees who received at least one payment. The cost of the scheme is over €500 million per month according to the Department of Finance.According to data from the Central Bank: “The TWSS supported a cumulative 663,600 people since its inception accounting for, 28 per cent of employment (in Q1 2020). At its peak (end-April), the TWSS supported 425,000 workers, with approximately 340,000 still in receipt of subsidy payments at the closing of the scheme in September. Seventy per cent of supported workers had been availing of the scheme prior to 1 May. On average 58% of recipients were male, 77% were Irish nationals and 39% were aged under 34 years.“At end-August, three sectors – Accommodation and Food Services (24%), Wholesale and Retail Trade and Repairs (19), and Industry (10) – accounted for more than half of the TWSS recipients (Table 1). Within sectors, Accommodation/Food (54% of workers) and Retail (24) workers are particularly reliant on subsidies.”According to the Irish Times: The employment wage subsidy scheme paid €1.4 billion to 39,800 employers in respect of 443,100 employees between September 2020 and January 2021.According to a paper by the Department of Social Protection: “as at April 23rd, males accounted for 61.5 per cent of TWSS employees. The principal age cohorts were those aged between 30-39 years and 40-49 years representing 25.9 and 24.9 per cent of employees, respectively. Across all sectors, 84 per cent of employees are receiving a ‘top up’ from their employer; with the highest proportion of Page 17 employees receiving top ups being seen in the Utilities (93.4 per cent) and Finance and Insurance (93 per cent) sectors.14 Aside from activities of households as employers, the Accommodation and Food services sector sees the largest share of employees without a top up under TWSS, at 30.2 per cent.”“Data from Revenue shows the scheme has predominantly been utilised by smaller firms; 66 per cent of enrolled firms employ fewer than 10 workers, although these firms account for less than 22 per cent of all employees on the scheme… Meanwhile, the share of employers using the scheme is heavily weighted towards smaller firms; with over 80 per cent of employers availing of the TWSS seen in firms with less than 20 workers.”",National government,,National funds,"Ibec, the group that represents Irish business, welcomed the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). Ibec CEO Danny McCoy said: _'The TWSS scheme offers a strong solution for business and workforce continuity. It will continue to play a vital role in enabling the economy to bounce back at the other end of this crisis, helping vulnerable firms to stay afloat and keeping their employees engaged whilst protecting the incomes of individuals.'_Patricia King, General-Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcomed the Government’s decision to establish a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to maintain jobs and support workers’ incomes during this unprecedented crisis, as first called for by ICTU in its letter of 18 March to the Taoiseach when we  outlined the urgent need for a 'temporary wage subsidy scheme’ that would help to keep workers in their jobs, protect them from unemployment and loss of income, and to help the economy rapidly recover when the COVID ends. _'These unprecedented times demand unprecedented measures to minimise the impact on workers, their families and the business community'_, Patricia King said.When the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was amended to allow women who were on maternity leave to access the payment, this was welcomed by ICTU. ICTU and the National Women’s Council had campaigned to have the anomaly addressed.Ibec welcomed the extension of the TWSS to 31 August. Chief Executive Danny McCoy said: _'The extension of the TWSS scheme until August will provide confidence to employers and employees, helping vulnerable firms to stay afloat and keeping their employees engaged whilst protecting the incomes of individuals.'_",Direct consultation,Consulted,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/documents/pmod-topics/guidance-on-operation-of-temporary-covid-wage-subsidy-scheme.pdf; https://www.thejournal.ie/wage-subsidy-covid-19-5086879-Apr2020/; https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/donohoe-tweaks-wage-subsidy-scheme-so-mothers-returning-from-maternity-qualify-1.4265920; https://revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/registrations/wage-subsidy-scheme-statistics-21-may-2020.pdf; https://www.ibec.ie/connect-and-learn/media/2020/06/05/business-welcomes-acceleration-of-covid-roadmap; https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/covid19/temporary-covid-19-wage-subsidy-scheme.aspx; Minister Donohoe announces extension of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme until end August; https://www.ictu.ie/bdc19/news/2020/06/02/opening-up-the-wage-subsidy-scheme-to-new-mothers/; https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/publications/economic-letters/vol-2020-no.11-wage-subsidies-and-job-retention-keenan-and-lydon.pdf?sfvrsn=23; https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/8f021-government-extends-subsidy-rates-for-the-employment-wage-subsidy-scheme-until-march-31st/; https://www.irishtimes.com/business/dark-economic-clouds-foreshadow-the-storm-yet-to-come-1.4451804; https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/97112d-minister-doherty-announces-the-publication-of-a-working-paper-on-the/

In this context, the Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth (BMAFJ) issued decrees clarifying exceptions to these rules.","The Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth (BMAFJ) issued several decrees to clarify on occupations which qualify as 'exceptional cases' according to the law. In a decree from 4 March 2020 it is defined that hospitals are an 'exceptional case' when they treat patients or perform tests in the context of COVID-19 and when other organisational measures (such as the purchase of additional test equipment and the inclusion of additional qualified personnel) are not possible on short notice. While rules on the daily maximum working time, duration of extended service hours, maximum number of extended service hours, and maximum weekly working hours in individual weeks will not apply in these cases, the average weekly working time can only be increased with written approval by the employee.In a decree from 16 April 2020, and applicable as of 11 April, it was also clarified that rules on driving and rest periods stemming from (EC) No 561/2006 will be adjusted.

Pre-empted by some of the registration bodies for doctors and nurses, the possibility for former health care staff to return to the register was enacted as part of the ‘Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020' on 27 March 2020.Medical and nursing schools in Ireland are fast tracking students to qualifications to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. A deal has also been reached between unions and the Health Service Executive to allow health care staff to be redeployed to private nursing homes. The Health and Safety Executive has launched a call to encourage health care workers to return to the service, as well as attracting health care workers from other countries currently in Ireland to assist with the effort to deal with COVID-19.In addition, it has also been made possible for public sector staff and teachers to be reassigned to other duties as required during the pandemic.","The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act passed in the Irish Parliament on 27 March 2020 introduces amendments to existing legislation in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The temporary provisions are intended ‘[…] to provide for the registration of certain health and social care professionals to fulfil the need for medical resources to alleviate the risk from COVID-19 to human life and public health and for those and related purposes to amend the Dentists Act 1985, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Pharmacy Act 2007, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, and the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011; […] to enable the re-enlistment of formerly enlisted persons; […]’. Prior to this (17 March), this Health Service Executive (HSE) launched the ‘Be on call for Ireland’ recruitment drive. This was aimed at the recruitment of additional qualified healthcare workers including medical, nursing and therapy personnel as well as healthcare assistants. On 10 April, the HSE announced that there will be an increase in the annual intake of medical interns this year, from 734 to approximately 1,100. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) and the Irish Medical Council also took steps to make it easier for nurses and doctors to return to the register (e.g. by waiving registration fees). The COVID-19 Act provides for health and social care professionals who want to return to work to have their applications to be registered with their regulatory bodies accelerated and returned to the register without paying a fee until 30 July 2020 (with possibility extend this date). Medical and nursing schools have also been fast-tracking students to qualification to deal with the pandemic.The Act also offers some protection to healthcare professionals, other than doctors, who may practise medicine during the pandemic (normally prohibited). They can do so under the direction and control of a registered medical practitioner, or in accordance with directions in writing given by a registered medical practitioner.With regard to other public servants and teachers, the Department of Education issued a circular to school managers on 27 March 2020 that indicated that all public servants 'must be available to carry out work either to deliver services within their own sector or for temporary assignment within the wider public service [...]'. The possibility to reassign public service staff is set out in Circular 7/2020, issued by the government on 17 March 2020.","A few days after the measure was enacted (1 April) the Irish Times reported that around 540 nurses and 140 doctors had re-joined the register. This famously includes the Irish Prime Minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar - who agreed to return to work to his former profession as a medical doctor for one day per week during the pandemic.In a statement to the Irish Independent, the HSE said: ""As of July 2, 194 doctors, nurses and health and social care appointees have been deployed from the Be on Call for Ireland initiative to HSE services in both community, acute and public health departments. An additional 715 candidates have full recruitment clearances in place and are 'job ready' as per service need. 940 candidates are in the clearance process'.According to the Irish Times: The nationwide campaign, which was launched by the Health Service Executive when the COVID-19 crisis escalated in early March, attracted responses from more than 73,000 applicants to support the health services.

Workers and technicians in short-time working will thus be paid 92% of their net salary, instead of the 84% provided for by the legal system. This is made possible by the solidarity of managers on partial unemployment, whose net pay will decrease from 100% to 92%.","Applicable until July 3, 2020, this agreement was put in place, thanks to the solidarity of managers and an additional contribution from the company, to erase the disparities in compensation between the different categories of employees, resulting from the legal provisions and the collective agreement of the Metallurgy. The agreement brings the remuneration of all employees to 92% of their usual net remuneration. According to the President of Renault Trucks France, ""this agreement makes it possible to treat all employees fairly during this unprecedented period of crisis. It offers each employee who wishes to do so, the opportunity to approach 100% of his or her remuneration through the use of days off, while safeguarding the future of the company. In addition to the solidarity contribution of the employees, the company's contribution amounts to 8% of the payroll"". In detail, on a voluntary basis, it is possible for all employees on short-time work to give 1.6 days for every 20 days they are unemployed to the company in order to keep their full pay. This agreement also secures the maintenance of individual salary increases with effect from 1 April 2020 and the payment of the profit-sharing bonus (prime d'intéressement) in June.

Three axes are planned to achieve this objective: * the creation of a ""social solidarity"" mechanism to supplement the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity situations; * the possibility of adapting the programming of holidays in each establishment; * the implementation of a reinforced protocol of barrier gestures. The agreement is applicable until  31 October 2020. The provisions concerning the creation of a solidarity fund will cease on 30 April 2020.","The main content of the measure consist of:1. **Solidarity Fund**Since March 16, 2020, all the activities of the group's industrial and commercial system have been stopped, which has led the company to place the vast majority of staff under the partial activity regime"", according to the agreement, which emphasizes that managers or technicians on fixed-days contracts already benefit from contractual provisions allowing them to maintain their remuneration in the event of partial unemployment. In order to enable all professional categories (employees, workers and technicians managers on lump-sum hours) to benefit from guaranteed remuneration for the period from 16 March to 30 April, the agreement sets up a solidarity fund. The fund will be financed by the payment of two days' leave for managers and one day for workers and technicians. Employees will be able to voluntarily pay the remainder of their paid leave that could not be used before 31 May 2020. For its part, PSA Automobiles undertakes to top up the days paid into the fund by 40%. These payments should make it possible to maintain employees' remuneration for a full month for 100% of the workforce. In the event that the partial activity is extended to all or part of the company's establishments, priority will be given to voluntary payments. If necessary, an additional number of days may be deducted. This may be done by half-day (excluding paid holidays) ""to adjust as best as possible to the gradual takeover of the sites"", up to a limit of 0.5 days for workers and technicians and one day for managers.2. **Arrangement of paid holidays**The agreement takes into account Order No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020 allowing for the adaptation of the terms and conditions for taking paid holidays. Thus, each head of establishment will be able to impose the taking of six working days of leave during the period of partial activity, from 7 April to 31 October 2020. This week of paid leave may be taken either consecutively if the site's activity has been completely suspended, or non-consecutively if the site's activity is partially maintained.With regard to the setting of the weeks of paid summer holidays, each head of establishment will also be able to adjust their positioning, provided that each employee is guaranteed at least 12 consecutive working days over the period between 1 July and 31 August. In this context, the agreement provides for priority in the choice of dates for employees whose spouses cannot change their departure dates, for single-parent families, and for employees working 100% during the period of partial activity in their establishment. The latter will also be able to keep the previously set dates, or take three consecutive weeks of leave. In addition, their unused leave balance as of May 31, 2020 may exceptionally be carried forward until December 31, 2020. Finally, the agreement specifies that all employees who have not been able to take their remaining paid leave before May 31, 2020, due to the resumption of activity or the needs of the establishments, will be able to take these days until July 31, 2020.3. **An enhanced security protocol**The agreement recalls that, since the start of the health crisis at COVID-19, PSA Automobiles has adopted a reinforced health protocol of barrier gestures (wearing of masks on site, respect of distances with floor markings, ventilation of work spaces, longer break times for hand washing, etc.). Currently being rolled out at all industrial, commercial, service and engineering sites, these measures are subject to internal audits and assessment by health and safety committees to ensure their ""perfect"" implementation. A presentation of the audit reports as well as a field trip with members of the staff representative bodies will make it possible to share these conclusions, to assess their content and to correct, if necessary, the measures taken locally. In addition, management undertakes to implement communication and awareness-raising actions associated with the deployment of the enhanced security protocol.","The agreement applies to about 68,000 employees in France.",Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,Companies; Employees; National funds,"The agreement has been signed by four representative trade unions (CFDT, CFTC, CFE-CGC and FO), excepted the CGT.",Direct consultation,Negotiated,Yes,Only private sector,"C29 Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers",No,,,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiQ3eTP66bpAhWPwMQBHc0SDYsQFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.industriall-europe.eu%2Fcontent%2Fdocuments%2Fupload%2F2020%2F4%2F637224848804873772_PSA-accord-social-solidaire-protecteur-de-la-sant%25C3%25A9-des-salari%25C3%25A9s-et-de-lentreprise.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1VLW_b5H7cCy8PwY5UYVe

Hourly rates differ according to the status and military rank of the army personnel and range from € 10.20 (for persons doing their basic, compulsory military training) to €34 (sergeant/corporal). Those rates were fixed around two decades ago. In total, costs of €1 million were estimated for the Post AG. The personnel costs were paid to the armed forces, while the soldieres themselves received their regular monthly incomes.By mid-May at least 79 employees of one major logistical center of the Austrian Post in Hagenbrunn, Lower Austria, have been tested positive for coronavirus and 30% of employees were on sick-leave. Another case of outbreak concerns a postal distribution center in Inzersdorf, Vienna, where 72 employees were tested positive. In both cases, contract tracing showed a link to the deployment of workers from a temporary work agency - some of which had been brought in shared buses to their workplace. ","Management from the Post had therefore requested help from the armed forces. The site was first disinfected by specialists from the Austrian armed forces team. About 280 soldiers and civilian servants were be deployed to replace the workforce for about two weeks in the sorting of the parcels and loading of truck in the Hagenbrunn center. 250,000 parcels have piled up in the two logistics centers in the meantime.Vienna City Councilor Peter Hacker, responsible for public health, confirmed the city of Vienna would take a closer look at the subject of temporary agency work and precarious employment in Vienna. In order to ensure continuity of business, management of the Post requested support. ","The federal army took stock after the two-week deployment in Hagenbrunn: the soldiers had unloaded and loaded around 1.5 million parcels from containers since May 16 and prepared them for further delivery for the mail delivery staff. 29,000 working hours were worked.

Out of a total of 29,000 hours, around 3,700 were carried out by the NBC defense force to protect logisticians.Around 33,000 working hours were worked in Inzersdorf, and in total, 1,050,000 parcels were dealt with. Up to 290 soldiers and civilian staff from the armed forces, NBC defence and the army base were deployed there. To minimise the risk of infection, the Army took sophisticated security precautions: All employees deployed were specially instructed in the procedures and protective measures before starting work, and throughout the logistics centre they were wearing mouth and nose protectors, gloves and safety shoes. In addition, separate recreation and sanitary areas were defined for the soldiers and civilian employees on site. Thus, there was no contact with the postal employees. In order to avoid mixing and to keep possible infection at a minimum, the soldiers were also divided into working groups.

The two latter forms are available in case of part time work and in case of both parents involving in care work for at least some few months.  For many parents, the COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainties about parental allowance. Parents in systemically relevant professions are needed at their workplace and have to work more hours than usual, while others are free or in short-time work and at risk to run into economic difficulties while receiving parental allowance.

SK-2020-25/896,Rent subsidies for business which had to stay closed,Dotácie nájomného,Slovakia,Applies nationwide,06/17/2020,06/30/2021,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,New aspects included into existing measure,Supporting businesses to stay afloat,Direct subsidies (full or partial),06/30/2020,"The first measures to help entrepreneurship during the corona crisis were more focused on maintaining jobs. In business, however, there is also a need for spaces that entrepreneurs rent to a significant extent from the owners. This measure in the form of a law is aimed at helping entrepreneurs who rent business premises and for which they have to pay rent. The state subsidy will go to pay part of the rent for the use of the premises, which were closed due to a government regulation for the spread of coronavirus. Entrepreneurs for whom the anti-pandemic measures of the state have limited their income and have rented their premises can apply for a subsidy from the Ministry of Economy for rent in the second wave of the pandemic. As in the first wave, the amount of the subsidy is the same as the discount provided by the landlord.","First, there is a negotiation between the landlord and the tenant about the amount of discount. The state pays the landlord a subsidy in the same amount as he gives the entrepreneur a discount on rent. The ceiling is 50% of the amount of rent for the period of difficult use of space. In such a case, the landlord will forgive half of the rent and the other half of the rent will be refunded by the state.The tenant for the period will not pay anything for renting the premises. If the landlord and the tenant agree on a lower discount (e.g. 30%), the state will contribute equally (30%) and the rest (40%) must be paid by the entrepreneur renting the premises. In this case, the tenant can spread the payment of unpaid rent in instalments over 48 months. During the payment, the landlord is not entitled to unilaterally increase the amount of rent. The assistance provided to the tenant is financed from the resources of the state budget of the Slovak Republic. The maximum amount of the grant for one applicant is €800,000. The subsidy covers only rent, not energy supply.","Based on a mutual agreement, the renter will ask the landlord to submit an application for a rent subsidy for the period of difficult use. The application is submitted by the landlord on behalf of the tenant, on the landlord's own account. The application must be signed on behalf of both parties, by all authorized persons of both entities, with a qualified electronic signature. The application is submitted to the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic in the period from 23 June 2020 to 30 November 2020. The total amount of available resources provided by the Ministry of Economy for this purpose is €200 million (for about 70,000 to 100,000 applicants). The funds come from national sources.By 24 August 2020, the MH SR received 9,562 applications for rent subsidies, of which 3,558 have already been paid. The amount of subsidies exceeded €6.5 million. However, the Minister, Richard Sulík, stated that the Ministry expected greater interest from entrepreneurs.By 1 December 2020, the Ministry of Economy registered 16,890 applications submitted by entrepreneurs and paid them €35.52 million in rental subsidies.On 3 March 2021, the Minister of Economy informed that the Ministry had already paid out 30,825 applications in the total amount of €56.8 million within the first and second wave of the pandemic. On the contrary, the first assumption that the scheme will be used by 100,000 applicants with an estimated subsidy of €200 million was not met. One of the problems is that landlords are often reluctant to provide a discount to users. According to the Ministry of Economy (14 May 2021), rental subsidies were provided in two rounds. The first round of assistance ended on 30 November 2020 and the Ministry of Economy paid 19,359 applications at the total amount of  about €39.9 million. In the second round from 1 December 2020 (as of 14 May 2021), the Ministry of Economy paid more than €49 million in rent subsidies to almost 35,000 applicants.",National government; Company / Companies,,National funds,"The measure was launched in mid June and at the time of writing, the responses of the social partners to the introduced measure are not yet available.",,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2020/155/20200617;  https://hsr.rokovania.sk/rokovania-hospodarskej-a-socialnej-rady-sr/?cms_location=rokovania-hospodarskej-a-socialnej-rady-sr; https://www.mhsr.sk/top/ziskat-dotaciu-na-najomne-mozu-uz-aj-podniky-v-tazkostiac; https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2020/264/20200929.htm; https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2020/349; https://www.mhsr.sk/press/r-sulik-nasou-ulohou-je-vyplacat-dotacie-nie-robit-rozhodcu-medzi-najomcom-a-prenajimatelo; https://www.economy.gov.sk/top/na-najomne-v-druhom-kole-pojde-vyssia-podpora-ako-za-cele-prve-kolo

For the time when a worker will not work, their employer will pay an allowance of 80% of the wage and subsequently be compensated by the state. Employers who cannot provide at least 10% of their employees with 90% of normal working time, i.e. 36 hours of work per week, will meet the basic qualifying condition for the subsidy.Employers can apply for this measure every month in the period from 1 June to 31 December 2020.","The measure aims at the protection and retention of jobs. The measure helps companies to overcome temporary stagnation and prevent layoffs by subsidising up to 50% of full-time wages.Workers covered by short-time subsidies scheme work at least 20 hours a week while, for the remaining working time, they are temporary laid off. For this part of working time (from 5 to 20 hours a week), the state pays monthly wage compensation:* €448 for 20-24 hours per week.* €336 for 25-29 hours.* €224 for 30-34 hours. * €112 for 35 hours.Employers must meet the following conditions:* Be registered in the Slovenian Business Register before 13 March 2020;* employ full-time workers.* Cannot provide at least 10% of his employees with at least 90% of the work load.* Are not direct or indirect budget users.* Conduct consultations with trade unions or work councils (or workers directly) about the number of employees working under short-time subsidies scheme, their working hours and duration of the measure.* Notify the Employment Service of Slovenia about short-time work.An employee who temporarily works short-time retains all rights and obligations as he or she would work full-time.

Measures include various projects:* Less rigid requirements for construction plans to boost the construction sector.* Tourist vouchers to help the tourist and hospitality sector.* State loans and grants to compensate the loss of income.* Financial incentives (loans and grants) to generate new investments and creation of new jobs.* Less rigid requirements for construction plans in agriculture and favorable agricultural rents (discounted or free of charge).Measures particularly address these sectors: tourism and hospitality, road transport, agriculture, manufacturing and others.","The second COVID-19 law intends to boost investments in the construction sector by an accelerated procedure in obtaining building permits. The law requires, for example, more rigid criteria from environmental organisations (at least 50 active members, 3 full-time employees holding a diploma in natural sciences, €10,000 of assets in the last three years) to participate in the procedure.The second and third COVID-19 laws help the tourist and hospitality sectors with tourist vouchers. Tourist agencies and organisers of sports events may issue vouchers instead of reimbursement for unrealised travels or events. Payment moratorium expires in 24 months. In order to revitalise the tourist sector, each permanent resident of Slovenia gets tourist vouchers (adults €200, minors €50), valid until 31 December 2020, to be spent on accommodation. The government estimates the cost of tourist vouchers at €345 million, while the multiplier effects are estimated to be €172 million.State grants and loans co-finance the loss of income in tourism and hospitality, provide support for manufacturing in the affected border areas, encourage digitalisation of companies and development projects. Micro, small and medium-sized companies as well as large companies affected by the pandemic are eligible. On top of this, the state gives €35 million to companies in the road transport industry, financial aid for managers of ski lifts, ranging from €1,000 to €12,200 per lift.Businesses meet less strict requirements for obtaining co-financing of investments until 30 June 2021. The incentives will be granted if the investment creates at least 10 jobs in the manufacturing or service sector, or 3 jobs in research and development within three years after its completion. The minimum threshold for investments is €12 million in manufacturing, €3 million in the service sector, and €2 million in research and development.Agricultural businesses may profit from less rigid requirements for building greenhouses, irrigation systems, and plantations until 31 December 2020, subsidies for the exploitation of geothermal energy for farming, or more favorable rents (discounted or free of charge) in agriculture.","More rigid criteria for environmental organisations raise concern in the public since new rules exclude environmental organisations from the procedure in obtaining the building permit. It is believed that new rules jeopardise the protection of nature. Adoption of this regulation is one of the motives for mass protests held every Friday evening. Ten protests so far gathered from a few thousand to ten thousand people. Other issues of disputes are corruption in the procurement of security and medical equipment, replacement of some top officials, the extension of the powers of the military, police brutality and others.The Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (UMAR) issued a study on the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the tourist sector. It quotes data of the Statistical Office from the year 2017 when the tourist sector had a share of 8.4% in GDP and employed about 55,000 employees. Seventy per cent of income came from foreign tourists, including daily and transit guests. The closure of borders and accommodation facilities during the epidemic brought down the tourist activities. In April 2020 the income was cut by 86% compared to April 2019. Only the food delivery at home was prosperous but limited to urban settlements.Tourist vouchers were supposed to boost tourism after the epidemic. The Ministry of Economic presupposed that about 70% of vouchers will be redeemed. On 23 August, this plan was far from being realised. The Financial Administration reported that about 20% of all tourist vouchers were redeemed until 23 August 2020. The proprietors of tourist vouchers have time to spend them until 31 December 2020.",National government; Social partners jointly,Sector specific set of companies,European Funds; National funds,"Both laws adopted many proposals of employer organisations.

It consists of thirteen measures of which one fourth are designed to support businesses and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), in particular, to obtain liquidity, cover the running operating costs of businesses, stay afloat and avoid dismissals. The Minister of Financed designed the package and it has been approved by the Cabinet.   ","The first measure provides for €800 million liquidity for the financing of Small and Medium Enterprises with favourable financing conditions and terms. The financing to SMEs will be done through the Cyprus Entrepreneurship Fund (CYPEF) and the bank institutes. Beneficiaries are SMEs with maximum number of employees to be 250 and the maximum amount of loan €1.5 million that are to be reimbursed over a period of twelve years. Interest rates will be lower than the current rates of banks with the potential of subsidy by the ‘Scheme of Interest Rates Subsidy’. The second measure, the ‘Scheme of Interest Rates Subsidy’, aims to improve liquidity for businesses and self-employed confronting sudden lack of liquidity through subsidy of new business loans. Competent and financing authority is the General Accounting Office of the Ministry of Finance. Beneficiaries of the scheme are all undertaking companies in accordance with the EU definition – very small, small, medium and large enterprises and self-employed - and the aim of the loan shall be the covering of liquidity needs for capital and investment purposes. The maximum interest rates for long is defined to 4.25% and the maximum period of subsidy will be four years. For the first two years the subsidy will be up to 3.5 percentage points and two percentage points for the third and fourth years. The third measure of this bundle is a lump sum subsidy targeting self-employed and very small businesses that have partially or fully suspended their activities integrated in the special schemes of the Ministry of Labour between 13 April and 12 May 2020. For businesses employing * up to one person the lump sum is €1,250, * 2-5 persons €3,000, * 6-9 persons €4,000 and * 10-50 persons €6,000. The purpose of the measure is for the covering of rents, operational expenses and other business debts. The fourth measure provides for the reduction of VAT from 9% to 5% for the period 1 July 2020 to 10 January 2020 in the sectors of tourist accommodation and catering. It is expected that the reduction will benefit the sectors that have been mostly affected by the pandemic as well as the businesses and consumers due to the increase of consumer demand.

According to the survey run by the Croatian Chamber of Economy which covered over 2,700 companies, 95% of companies had reported a decline in turnover and 28% suffered a decline of 100%. Three-quarters of the companies surveyed, or 74%, reported drops in production, and a fifth of them, or 21%, had seen their production fall by 100%. Supply chains have also been impacted by the outbreak, with 61% of companies reporting problems. Forty-five percent of companies recorded declines in exports and 41% reported falls in imports. In such circumstances it is no wonder that 42% of those polled are considering layoffs and as many as 37% are thinking of closing down. Therefore, special measures were needed for micro-businesses, primarily by co-financing wages and granting them moratoriums on loan repayments. At the session held on June 29, 2020, the Croatian Employment Service Management Board adopted specific measure in this regard related to micro-entrepreneurs.The Croatian Employment Service unifies two measures: “Support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by COVID-19“ [HR-2020-12/361](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HR-2020-12_361.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19) and this measure ""Support for preservation of jobs by micro-entrepreneurs whose economic activity has been disrupted due to a special circumstance caused by the COVID-19” (HR-2020-27/921). ","Target groups of employers are those who perform economic activity and employ up to 10 workers. Target groups of workers are all insured persons with the eligible employer, regardless of whether they have a permanent or fixed-term employment, including founders, members of the management board, directors, procurators, and business owners. The target group of workers does not include pensioners and foreigners from third countries whose residence and work permits have expired.Employers who use measures of the Croatian Employment Service (CES) and other organisations, cannot use both measures at the same time. If more than one business entity has the same founder or owner who individually employs less than 10 employees, and all business entities together have more than 10 employees, the support will not be granted. Employers can choose to suspend contractual obligations under active contracts of active labour market policy (ALMP) measures by CES that include the covering the cost of wages. At the end of the period of application of this measure, they will continue to use the ALMP measure in the remaining period. Employers need to prove that in June 2020 they had a decrease in income by at least 50% compared to June 2019, based on the submission of the VAT form for June 2020 and June 2019. If the employer operates for less than 12 months, it is necessary to prove a decrease in turnover by at least 50% in June 2020 compared to February 2020 based on the submission of the VAT form for June and February 2020. The monthly amount of the support is HRK 2,000 (€267) for July 2020 per full-time employee, while for part-time employees it is the proportional according to the contractual number of hours. The support period is July 2020, yet the Administrative Board of the Croatian Employment Service will decide each month on the extension of the measure.

Such taxpayers recalculate the specific tax for 2020 by dividing the annual specific tax by 365 days and multiplying it by the number of days corresponding to the period in the calendar year in which they performed the activity.In June 2020, after the expiry of some provisions of GEO 48/2020, the government came with another GEO (99/2020) stating that, for 2020, no specific tax is due for a period of 90 days as of the date of entry into force of GEO 99/2020. The amount due is calculated by dividing the tax by 365 and multiplying the resulting value by 275 (i.e. the difference between 365 days and 90 days).

In view of this, Government announced that €100 vouchers would be distributed to all individuals aged 16 and over that can be used in a licensed accommodation, restaurants, bars or business that had closed due to the pandemic.","Every resident in Malta and Gozo aged over 16 years old will receive a voucher of €100 which can be used on Malta Tourism Authority (MTA) licensed accommodation, this includes hotels and holiday homes. The voucher can also be used at restaurants, bars and retail outlets. Specifically, five €20 vouchers will be issued to every resident, €80 can be used for accommodation, restaurants or bars, while the remaining €20 can be used in any retail outlets that were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.Whilst it was originally announced by Government that only individuals who are registered on Malta's electoral register would receive such vouchers, it was later clarified that foreigners who had a Malta residence permit will also receive them.Distribution of the vouchers began on the 8 July 2020 via registered mail.","440,000 individuals residing in Malta are expected to receive vouchers worth €100. In September 2020 during a press conference, the Prime Minister, Robert Abela, noted that some 60% of the vouchers generated the same expenditure as 40,000 tourists did in August 2019.The Economy Minister announced that as per 14 October 2020, 98% of Maltese residents, 65% of EU residents, and 83% of non-EU residents had received their vouchers. 81% of all distributed vouchers had been used: 2.23 million vouchers were issued and 1.81 million vouchers were used. It was also stated that the measure cost €44 million over a three month period. A total of 5,720 outlets received vouchers.In June 2021, it was announced that the first round of vouchers had injected €37 million into sectors hard hit by COVID-19.

Conversely, the General Workers' Union supported the package.In September 2020 various employer associations called for the voucher scheme to be re-issued. The Malta Employer's Association called for their re-issuing but stated that some should be exclusively for retail and catering outlets. The Chamber of SMEs also called for them to be re-issued but asked for greater focus on retail and those providing services affected by COVID-19. During a 15 October 2020 panel discussion of employer associations, a general consensus was expressed that the vouchers helped stimulate business, particularly in Gozo.

By means of a tripartite agreement, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was agreed and announced by the Government on 24 March 2020. Amongst the measures in this package, wage subsidies were offered to sectors which were worst hit. During a 'mini budget' announced on the 8 June 2020, which aimed to regenerate Malta's economy, Government announced that organisations which were eligible for the wage subsidy were now also eligible to apply for an electricity bill refund. ","During the first months of resuming operations (July, August and September 2020) businesses eligible for the [COVID-19 Wage Supplement](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/MT-2020-13_264.html) _'will be assisted on 50% of a commercial rate account up to an amount of €1,500 per applicant.'_ The measure focuses on operating costs, and thus the amount does not include the payment for the electricity meter. The total cost of this measure is expected to reach just over €30 million.Full details of this measure were published on 27 August 2020, this highlighted that the maximum grant of €1,500 was for those with a single electricity account. Those with more agreements (up to 5), as they operate from multiple sites, could receive a grant of up to €7,500. ","For July till September 2020, 6,422 applications were submitted to Malta Enterprise, covering a total of 7,274 bills.It was announced on the 19 December 2020 that the first round of repayments as part of the electricity bill refund scheme were to be distributed. The four sectors that had applied for this refund where the Whole sale and retailers (33%), accommodation and food (27%), personal services such as hairdressers (16%) and manufacturing (8%). It was further clarified in Q1 of 2021 by the Malta Enterprise that following a verification process of applications, this scheme would be assisting 3,280 companies and 1,860 self employed individuals.

The MHRA had been vocal about the need for electricity subsidies prior to the announcement and expressed their support for this particular measure once announced. The Gozo Business Chamber also welcomed both the package and this specific measure.The feedback on the overall package from unions was more mixed; The Union Ħaddiema Magħqudin (UHM) Voice of the Workers argued that only 6% of €900 million of this package will end up benefitting workers directly. Furthermore, they questioned why electricity subsidies were not being extended to workers too. Conversely, the General Workers' Union supported the package.A September 2020 Malta Employers' Association survey highlighted limited satisfaction with the electricity refund measure; 16% of respondents felt that it was effective. The COVID-19 wage supplement scored highest with 62%.In April 2021, it was announced that the electricity refund scheme as well as several other schemes were to be re-issued. Reacting to this package of measures, the Chamber for SMEs (an employers association) welcomed the new financial assistance and highlighted that the package was the result of intense consultation between their members as well as with the Ministry for Energy, Enterprise and Sustainable Development.

The plan is focused on boosting economic recovery, following the UK's lockdown and the recent easing of restrictions. The Chancellor described the plan as the 'second phase' of response to the coronavirus crisis and as being about jobs. He began his speech by stating that the government will not accept rising unemployment and that it will do all it can to give 'everyone the opportunity of good and secure work.' The Plan for Jobs has 'a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs', given the 25% contraction in the UK economy in the preceding months and the predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility and Bank of England as to significant job losses.","These initiatives are aimed at supporting young people, who it is predicted, will be hardest hit by the crisis (the Chancellor reported that the under-25s are two and a half times more likely to work in a sector that has been closed e.g. retail and hospitality). The new Kickstart Scheme is thus a 'new programme to give hundreds of thousands of young people, in every region and nation of Britain, the best possible chance of getting on and getting a job.'Under the scheme, employers will be directly paid to create new jobs for any 16 to 24-year-old at risk of long-term unemployment. These will have to be new jobs, as the funding will be conditional on proof that these jobs are additional. The jobs will have to be 'decent'; with a minimum of 25 hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.  Employers will also have to provide 'Kickstarters' with training and support to find a permanent job. If employers meet these conditions, the Government will pay young people’s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads. Thus, for a 24-year-old, the grant will be around GBP 6,500.Employers can apply to be part of the scheme from August. There is to be no cap on the numbers of places available and the Chancellor has pledged an initial GBP  billion, a sum he says will be enough to fund hundreds of thousands of jobs.The Government also pledged on the 8 July to: * pay employers GBP 1,000 to take on new trainees, with triple the number of places;* provide GBP 100 million to create more places on Level 2 and 3 courses, so as to support 18-19-year olds leaving school or college to find work in high-demand sectors like engineering, construction and social care; * funding for new careers advisers to support over a quarter of a million more people; * for the next six months, paying employers to create new apprenticeships and paying businesses to hire young apprentices, with a payment of GBP 2,000 per apprentice. * In addition, there will be a new bonus for businesses to hire apprentices aged 25 and over, with a payment of GBP 1,500.","As yet unknown. The package was announced on the 8 July, 2020.The scheme was launched on the 2 September and within the first 24 hours, more than 6,000 employers had started an application. ",National government; Company / Companies,Other groups of workers; Youth (18-25) in employment,National funds,It can be assumed that the partners from both sides would be supportive of the measure.,,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-plan-for-jobs-speech; https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-kickstart-scheme-opens

Under the BBLS, businesses will be able to apply for quick and easy-to-access loans between GBP 2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover; the maximum loan available under the Scheme is GBP 50,000. No loan repayments are required for the first 12 months and the government will cover the interest repayments for the same period.For those businesses seeking more than GBP 50,000, BBLS is intended to sit alongside the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).   Under CBILS, a participating lender can provide up to GBP 5 million in the form of term loans, overdrafts, invoice finance or asset finance.  Both schemes are operated by the British Business Bank, through accredited lenders","The scheme helps small and medium-sized businesses to borrow between GBP 2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover. The maximum loan available is GBP 50,000. The government guarantees 100% of the loan and there are no fees or interest to pay for the first twelve months. After twelve months, the interest rate will be 2.5% a year.An SME can apply for the loan if the business: * is based in the UK* was established before 1 March 2020* has been adversely impacted by the coronavirus.SMEs from any sector can apply with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers); public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. If a firm is already claiming funding under the CBILS (a loan of up to GBP 50,000), then this can be transferred into the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Businesses have until the 4th of November to arrange this with their lender. The loan will run for six yearsThe length of the loan is 6 years, but businesses can repay early without paying a fee. No repayments will be due during the first 12 months.The scheme is being run under the auspices of the British Bank, with eleven lenders participating in the scheme (including many of the main retail banks). Businesses should approach a suitable lender directly via the lender’s website. Applicants must complete a short online form and self-declare eligibility. The lender will make the decision as to whether a loan will be offered.","HM Treasury has published data on the total number of applications received, the number of successful applications and on the cumulative value of all loans/facilities granted.Thus, on the 10 May, 363,646 applications had been received, of which 268,173 had been successful with a value of GBP 8.38 billion. By the 31 May, there had been 873,192 applications, of which 699,354 had been approved.

The Fund is aimed at innovative and high-growth British businesses, to facilitate their ability to secure investment during the coronavirus outbreak.  The Fund will be open until September and is delivered in partnership with the British Business Bank. It is part of the raft of financial measures. launched by the government as part of its response to the crisis. ","Announced by the Chancellor on the 20th of April, the Future Fund issues convertible loans from GBP 125,000 to GBP 5 million, to innovative UK companies with good potential, that typically rely on equity investment and are currently affected by COVID-19. The government funding is subject to at least equal match funding from private investors.These convertible loans may be an option for businesses that rely on equity investment and are unable to access other government business support programmes because they are either pre-revenue or pre-profit.The key features of the scheme are as follows. The application process is investor-led. This means an investor, or lead investor of a group of investors, applies in connection with an eligible company. The Future Fund will match up to 100% of the amount provided by investor(s), up to a maximum of GBP5 million.  The Future Fund loan amount provided to the company ranges from GBP 125,000 to GBP 5 million (this must be at least co-matched by investor capital).  Funding must not be used to * repay any borrowings;* pay any dividends; * pay any bonuses; * pay any advisory fees. The loans will have a minimum of 8% per annum (non-compounding) interest charge applied. This interest will be higher if the company and the investor(s) agree between themselves. Unlike a typical bank loan, the interest is not payable on a monthly basis and instead will accrue until the loan converts. At this point, the interest will either be repaid or convert in equity. The loan will mature after 36 months.  The loan cannot be repaid early by the company other than with the agreement of all of the investors.  The loans will convert into shares in the company in certain circumstances, including an exit or a new funding round.In order to be eligible for the scheme, each of the investor(s) and the company must meet specific criteria.To be eligible for the scheme, the company must meet the following criteria:1. The company must have raised at least GBP 250,000 in equity from third-party investors in previous funding rounds in the last five years (from 1 April 2015 to 19 April 2020, inclusive).2. If the company is a member of a corporate group, it must be the ultimate parent company.3. The company does not have any of its shares or other securities listed on a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, a recognised investment exchange and/or any other similar market, stock exchange or listing venue.4. The company must be a UK incorporated limited company or be eligible to apply as a non-UK parent company.5. The company must have been incorporated on or before 31 December 2019 (or in the case of a non-UK jurisdiction company*, this criterion applies only to at least one UK subsidiary operating company).6. At least one of the following must be true for the company:* Half or more employees are UK based* Half or more revenues are from UK salesThe scheme's eligibility criteria have been amended to include innovative companies that participate in accelerator programmes based outside the UK.  Where before, these companies didn’t qualify because they had to register in an overseas jurisdiction to take part in an accelerator programme, the new criteria means they can now access the fund, providing they meet all other conditions for eligibility. The scheme is designed by government and delivered by the British Business Bank. Initially, GBP 250 million was made available by the government for investment through the scheme, to be matched by private investors. However, the Treasury made clear that the amount could be increased if needed.  ","The Government has allocated GBP 250 million to the Future Fund, which will initially run until the end of September. Government may extend the scheme thereafter.HM Treasury has published data on the total number of applications received, the numbers of successful applications and the (cumulative) value of all successful applications. On the 7 June, 533 applications had been received, of which 53 had been approved to a value of GBP 55.9m.

To achieve this, the social partners argued, it was necessary that the government relaxed the regulations for unemployment benefits and removed the restrictions that makes it difficult or impossible for employees to combine training with unemployment benefits. A temporary scheme was put in place on 20 April 2020, and gives the unemployed and lay-offs possibility to combine training with unemployment benefits to a greater extent than before.

Depending on the activity, this includes, for example, the possibilities for home office, redesigning workplaces to maintain a safe distance, installed barriers such as plexiglass walls or the use of personal protective equipment.The third COVID-19 Law paved the way for defining specific ""risk groups"", to which further protective measures apply. Employed workers with a very high risk of developing a serious illness if becoming infected with the Corona virus are entitled to work from their home office or to a change in working conditions (meaning that the working conditions must be designed in such a way that infection with COVID-19 is almost impossible, taking into account the way to work). Ultimately, if this is not possible, a paid temporary leave of absence can be obtained with full payment by the employer, who will be reimbursed in full by the social security system for the wage costs (including ancillary wage costs).An expert group consisting of three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Nursing and Consumer Protection, one representative from the Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, three representatives from the Medical Association and three representatives from the social security system held several meetings based on previous experience with COVID-19 sufferers in Austria's hospitals and the international scientific results identified the groups of people who could have a higher risk of developing a serious illness. ","The COVID-19 risk group regulation lists the medical reasons (indications) for belonging to the COVID-19 risk group. Based on these indications, a doctor may issue a COVID-19 risk certificate.The main medical indications are:1. advanced chronic lung diseases that require permanent, daily, dual medication2. chronic heart diseases with end organ damage that require permanent therapy, such as ischemic heart diseases and heart failure3. active cancer with oncological pharmacotherapy (chemotherapy, biologics) and / or radiation therapy within the past six months, and metastatic cancer even without ongoing therapy4. diseases that need to be treated with immunosuppression5. advanced chronic kidney disease6. chronic liver diseases with organ remodeling and decompensated liver cirrhosis from Childs stage B7. pronounced obesity from obesity grade III with a BMI> = 408. diabetes mellitus9. arterial hypertension with existing end organ damage, especially chronic heart or kidney failure, or uncontrollable blood pressure adjustment.These main medical indications are further divided and described in detail in the regulation.In addition, other, similarly serious diseases with functional or physical limitations can provide special protection through a COVID-19 risk certificate.Most members of the risk group were identified through their medication via their health insurance. They received letters by their social security institution after the legal provisions came into force in May. Furthermore, an individual risk analysis can be obtained by a physician (e.g. for patients with a cancer therapy who do not take any ""prescribed medication"" because they receive their treatment in the hospital or dialysis patients). The doctor carries out the risk assessment together with the patient based on the recommendations for individual risk analysis for a severe course of the disease. If there is a serious underlying illness that meets these recommendations, a COVID-19 risk certificate is issued.Employers and those affected must jointly consider whether special protective measures are possible in the workplace. If this is not possible, home office can be used. If this is not possible either, workers belonging to the risk group are entitled to paid leave from work.","According to information from the Minister from 21 April 2020, around 90,000 workers are expected to belong to the risk group.

Thus, a total amount of DKK 730 million (€98 million) is reserved for new upgrading and training initiatives in order to mitigate the effects of unemployment and company closures due to the coronavirus crisis. Targeted education can ensure better wage income and job opportunities, and education can equip Danes for the new jobs that occurs in the short and long term. The parties to the agreement agree to invest primarily in the education of unskilled, graduates and entrepreneurs who are particularly vulnerable during the corona crisis.","From 1 August 2020 on and during 2021 insured unemployed of 30 years of age or more will have the right to start a vocational education with 110% of their previous unemployment benefit rate if the education is in an area where there is a need for labour.  A total amount of DKK 730 million (€98 million) is reserved for the upgrading and training initiatives. Thus, if a person receives the highest unemployment benefit rate on DKK 19,000 (€2,550), another DKK 1,900 (€255) will be added.Unskilled unemployed thus have the right to start an education such as blacksmith, electrician or other professions where there is a demand for hands. They can continue their education, even if it lasts longer than the unemployment benefit period. With the agreement, insured unemployed people will have the right to start six weeks of job-oriented training from the first day of unemployment and not after five weeks, as is the requirement today. The social partners will identify the courses that the unemployed can access immediately.Besides, the parties to the agreement agree that relevant formal training must be developed in areas where there is an urgent need for labour with special competencies related to the handling of COVID-19. It can be within testing, infection detection, care, laboratory technology, etc.","An evaluation of the temporary right of 110% of the unemployment benefit during education was published in May 2021 by STAR (The Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment), and the main results and conclusions are as follows:* The right has led to a boost in local authorities' focus on getting more people to complete an education boost while they are unemployed.* The municipalities estimate that the right strengthens the opportunities to motivate the unemployed to take a training boost. The new system has made it easier for citizens to opt for education.* Both the already recorded level of activity and the municipalities' expectations for the future indicate that the right will result in a significant boost in activity during the funding.* The educational lift initiative comes primarily from the job centre and supports the picture that job centres provide active guidance and advisory advice on opportunities in the educational lift.* For some of the citizens, the possibility of 110% unemployment benefit means that the route of training becomes an option. However, it is mainly believed that there are good job opportunities afterwards that motivate the unemployed to take a training boost.",National government; Social partners jointly,Unemployed,National funds,No information.,,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://bm.dk/nyheder-presse/pressemeddelelser/2020/06/bredt-politisk-flertal-haever-dagpengene-under-uddannelse/; https://bm.dk/nyheder-presse/pressemeddelelser/2021/06/mulighed-for-110-pct-dagpenge-faar-markant-flere-til-at-starte-paa-uddannelse/; https://star.dk/media/18166/evaluering-af-den-midlertidige-ret-til-uddannelsesloeft-og-korte-kurser.pdf

Businesses may apply to the local branch of the National Employment Office (which acts as a state authority) for a full grant of 100% of wages for six months for employing a registered job-seeker, which is then reviewed. The candidate for the job can be stated in the application form or it can be selected (recruited) by the Employment Office. If the application is approved, the Office signs a contract with the employer which includes details and conditions about the grant. This is a _de minimis_ subsidy, so the rules of decree 1407/2013/EU apply. (Meaning that certain sectors such as export-linked sectors, farming and fisheries are excluded.)","Businesses that apply for this subsidy will receive 100% of the wages and social contributions of the employee for six months, but they must promise to keep them on for another three months at least after the grant period at their own expense. The subsidy cannot exceed HUF 200,000 (€595) per month including social taxes. The employer must choose between two options when applying for the support:* Headcount increase: the new hire will result in an increase or be level to the existing headcount at the firm (counting part-time workers as one) on the day the application is submitted* Net headcount increase: the new hire must be an addition to (or stay level with) the headcount _average in the six months prior to submitting the application_, meaning that any workers laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be re-hired with the help of this subsidy.The amount earmarked for this subsidy is HUF 80 billion (€238 million).","The Ministry for Innovation and Technology announced it can help 70,000 people with the measure (calculated by expecting that most companies will apply for the maximum amount of subsidy).

By means of a tripartite agreement, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was agreed and announced by the Government on 24 March 2020. Amongst the measures in this package, wage subsidies were offered to sectors which were worst hit. During a 'mini budget' announced on the 8 June 2020, which aimed to regenerate Malta's economy, Government announced that organisations which were eligible for the wage subsidy were now also eligible to apply for a rent refund. ","On the 24 March 2020, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was announced by the Government. The most meaningful of the measures announced was the [COVID-19 Wage Supplement](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/MT-2020-13_264.html) by which employers in specific sectors were to receive a sum of money per employee, which was in turn to be passed on to the said employees. The amount of money received from the government depended on the sector with the Government dividing organisations into 'Annex A' and 'Annex B'. Those in Annex A received a larger wage supplement than those in Annex B.On 1 June 2020, Government announced that organisations listed in Annex A and Annex B, that have been granted the Wage Supplement will now also be able to apply for a rent refund grant of up to €2,500 by submitting their lease agreements.Full details of this measure were published on 27 August 2020, this highlighted that the maximum grant of €2,500 was for those with a single premises.

Those positive and vocal about it were primarily business associations, including the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of SMEs, the Malta Employers' Association, the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association (MHRA), and the Association of Catering Establishments. The measure specifically about the rent refund however received some criticism from some employers as it was considered to be insufficient.A September 2020 Malta Employers Association survey did not highlight high support for the rent refund by members; 8% considered it effective (in comparison, the Wage Supplement received a 62% rating).In April 2021, it was announced that the rent refund scheme as well as several other schemes were to be re-issued.

To a large extent, the increase in unemployment in Bulgaria comes precisely from this type of companies, which do not have much capital and cannot afford to make a normal or negative profit for several months in a row.Some associations such as Bulgarian Association of Consultants for European Programs (BACEP) and Bulgarian Industrial Association expressed the opinion that some steps and requirement in the application process might be too complex or inconvenient for micro and small business (e.g. requirements for electronic signature or too long and complicated contracts).

The TWSCS scheme tops up the economy-wide TWSS to 100% of the childcare worker's pre-COVID-19 wage levels, up to a limit of €585 per week. For the childcare provider, the scheme also paid 15% of payroll to cover ongoing overheads outside of pay or a minimum payment of €300 per week per childcare provider.The scheme replaced all other state supports for the childcare sector, which are suspended for the duration of the scheme.","As of Wednesday, April 22, 3,533 childcare providers had signed up for the TWSCS, out of a total of about 4,600 providers nationally.

However, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which provided the scheme, said wages were 70% of costs and that its provision for overheads was relatively higher for smaller providers.  The largest union in the sector, SIPTU, strongly welcomed the scheme, saying it would help childcare providers in retaining staff in the sector during the lockdown.

In the 2008/09 financial and economic crisis, a slump of 20% in the number of new apprentices occurred, according to the economic minister. In order to prevent a similar decrease now, a bonus payment for all those companies employing apprentices and for companies taking over apprentices from supra-company placements are paid.","The federal government pays companies a bonus of €2,000 for every apprentice hired between 16 March and 31 October 2020. The money is to be paid in two tranches: €1,000 at the start of the apprenticeship and €1,000 if retained after the probationary period (usually three months). Funding will also be provided for taking over apprentices in the first year of training from an inter-company apprenticeship scheme until 31 March 2021. If the apprenticeship is terminated during the probationary period, the first instalment will have to be paid back.This bonus is in addition to a pre-existing basic subsidy that is being paid to all companies training apprentices in the amount of three gross monthly apprenticeship payments in the first apprenticeship year.In total, €62.7 million are budgeted for the measure.","In mid-December, 11,700 applications had been filed, €22 million had been paid for around 12,000 apprentices.By June 2021, around €50 million have been paid to 12,915 companies.",National government; Employers' organisations; Company / Companies,Other groups of workers; Youth (18-25) in employment,National funds,"The WKO is pleased about the bonus. Its Deputy Secretary General states that it will help ""to ensure that there will be no training gap after the corona crisis"". Without apprentices, companies would lack the next generation of skilled workers.The Chamber of Labour (AK) has mixed feelings about the new bonus. Despite the basic subsidies that have been available for decades (see content of the measure), the number of newly hired apprentices has been falling for many years. The AK does not only want to support companies, but also to provide enough money for supra-company training, so that all young people can complete their training up to their final qualification.The youth organisation of the Trade Union Federation (ÖGJ) is partially content with the measure, and continues to call for a Corona emergency training fund, endowed with €140 million, supporting those companies that have economic difficulties caused by the corona crisis. In addition, the distribution of the support is to be linked to the quality of the training.

In case the law stipulates that an institution or a person, who are not beneficiaries of a certain claim are authorized to initiate foreclosure or securing proceedings for such claim, such institution or a person act as creditors, i.e. submitters of motion in such proceedings. Foreclosure orders are issued exclusively on basis of enforceable or credible documents. Enforceable documents are: enforceable court decision and enforceable judiciary settlement, enforceable settlement from Article 186.a of the Law on Civil Proceedings, enforceable decision of arbitration court, enforceable decision passed in administrative proceedings and enforceable settlement in administrative proceedings, in case they refer to payment of a monetary claim and unless law stipulates otherwise, enforceable notarial decision and enforceable notarial document, settlements entered into in proceedings in front of court of honour at chambers in the Republic of Croatia and settlements entered into in mediation proceedings, in accordance with provisions of the law stipulating mediation proceedings, and other documents stipulated by law as enforceable documents. Pursuant to the Law on Enforcement, credible documents are invoices, bills of exchange, cheque with protest and returned invoices, whenever it is necessary to constitute a claim, public documents, extracts from commercial records, legally notarized private documents that are considered to be public documents in accordance with special regulation. Calculation of accrued interest is considered to constitute invoice.Foreclosure orders in the basis of enforceable documents are passed by courts and on the basis of credible documents by public notaries. Public notary is under obligation to issue and submit foreclosure order or to forward the file to the court within 30 days, at the latest, counting from the date of receipt of motion. Responsible institution for the foreclosure procedure is the Financial Agency (FINA). In case the debtor does not receive foreclosure, one more delivery shall be attempted within time limit that may not be shorter than 30 or longer than 60 days. In case of failed repeated delivery, document that had to be submitted shall be posted on court e-notice board. After that, in case debtor does not file a complaint, foreclosure order becomes valid and enforceable. Upon enforceability of foreclosure order, proceedings are continued in front of agency that implements foreclosure order in accordance with provisions of the Law on Enforcement and the law stipulating foreclosure of monetary assets. Further proceedings depend on whether the debtor has sufficient assets to pay the debt or not. Law on enforcement does not stipulate time limit in which foreclosure order must be issued. In practice, courts issue foreclosure orders within 2-3 months.","The government issued a decree on amendments to Zakon o provedbi ovrhe na novčanim sredstvima (The Act on the foreclosure on pecuniary assets) (OG 68/18, 2/20 and 46/20) and after the article 25, added two articles 25.a and 25.b) which define special circumstances when foreclosure can be postponed in special circumstances. Due to the Act, the Financial Agency (FINA) will not perform foreclosure procedure on pecuniary assets of natural persons. The Decree is valued for three months with the possibility on extension for next three months. During the mentioned period of postponed foreclosure, no income interest should be calculated and paid.  ","As many natural persons in Croatia face serious problems with foreclosure, such measure should be very welcomed in the circumstances of COVID19 and present financial difficulties. This is particularly important knowing that the Act allows for HRK 100 (€ 13) of initial debt to become HRK 1,000 (€130), with almost no limit.

It also provides for the suspension or postponement of ongoing or future electoral processes, extending the term of office and protection against dismissal of current elected officials. This text was adopted pursuant to the Emergency Act to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic of 23 March 2020. As a reminder, the state of health emergency was declared for a period of two months from 24 March 2020, by the said emergency law, and has been extended to the 10 July 2020.","The main provision are the following:**1.

The employer may only have recourse to the instant messaging system in a subsidiary manner if it is impossible to organise the meeting by videoconference or telephone conference.In all cases, the employer must first inform the members of the body of these meeting arrangements. This measure is applicable to meetings convened during a state of health emergency (24 March 2020-10 July 2020). The limit of three videoconference meetings per calendar year provided for, in the absence of agreement, by Articles L. 2315-4 (for the CSE) and L. 2316-16 (for the Central CSE) of the Labour Code only applies to meetings organised outside the period of the state of health emergency.**2.

The CSE shall give its opinion within one month of receiving this information. The employer may act without waiting for the opinion of the ESC to be delivered.The same applies when an employer implements a derogation from working hours or Sunday rest, as a decree allows him to do so in application of the above-mentioned ordinance of 25 March 2020.**3.

Intended for companies facing a lasting reduction in activity, it can be implemented either by a company, establishment or group agreement validated by the administration, or by a document drawn up by the employer - on the basis of an extended branch agreement - and approved. It will apply until 30 June 2022. This temporary arrangement can be implemented until 30 June 2022. It complements the classic partial unemployment scheme (or ""partial activity"") which will be modified on 1 October 2020. An employer will not be able to combine the two schemes for the same employees over the same period.A reduction in activity limited to 40% of the legal durationThe APLD makes it possible to reduce the activity of employees, within the limit of 40% of the legal working time. This reduction in activity is assessed for each employee concerned, over the period of application of the system provided for in the collective agreement or unilateral document: this assessment framework therefore makes it possible to envisage a temporary suspension of activity.The 40% limit may be exceeded in exceptional cases resulting from the particular situation of the company, by decision of the administrative authority. However, the decree specifies that the limit may be exceeded only under the conditions laid down in the collective agreement and that the reduction in the working hours may not exceed 50 % of the legal duration.A capped allowance for employeesAs in the case of traditional partial activity, it is the employer who pays each employee placed in the APLD scheme directly an hourly allowance for partial activity, equal to 70 % of his gross remuneration serving as the basis for the holiday pay reduced to an hourly rate on the basis of the legal working time applicable in the company, or, where this is lower, on the basis of the collective working time or that stipulated in the employment contract. Employees therefore continue to benefit from the payment of 84% of their net salary.However, the compensation is capped: the maximum remuneration taken into account for the calculation of the hourly allowance is in fact equal to 4.5 times the hourly rate of the minimum wage.The partial activity allowance paid to employersThe employer receives a partial activity allowance, the hourly rate of which is equal for each employee concerned to:* 60% of the gross hourly pay corresponding to the basis of the holiday pay allowance, up to a limit of 4.5 times the hourly rate of the minimum wage, for agreements that will be sent to the administrative authority before 1 October 2020;* 56% of the gross hourly remuneration serving as the basis for the holiday pay allowance, for agreements transmitted to the administrative authority as from 1 October 2020, the date announced for the entry into force of the reformed arrangements for compensation for partial activity under ordinary law.It should be noted that the decree only covers the transmission of agreements: there is every reason to believe that the compensation rates will be the same for unilateral documents transmitted for approval before or as from 1 October 2020, and that the criterion to be taken into account is the date on which the application for approval or validation is sent.The hourly rate of the allowance is subject to a floor and may not be less than €7.23, with the exception of employees on apprenticeship or professionalization contracts.The content of the collective agreementWhether it is concluded at the level of the establishment, the undertaking, the group or the branch, the collective agreement setting up the long-term partial activity scheme must include a preamble presenting a diagnosis of the economic situation and business prospects of the establishment, the undertaking, the group or the branch.The agreement must then define :* the starting date and the duration of application of the long-term partial activity scheme;* the activities and employees to which the scheme applies;* the maximum reduction of working hours below the legal duration;* employment and vocational training commitments;* the procedures for informing the signatory employee trade unions and employee representative institutions about the implementation of the agreement, which must be provided at least every three months.Although the text does not expressly refer to it, the agreement must also lay down the conditions under which the 40% activity reduction limit may be exceeded: otherwise, such an overrun could not be authorised.",No data as the scheme is new.,National government,Employees in standard employment; Workers in essential services,Companies; National funds,Globally social partners support this scheme.,,,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000042169955&categorieLien=id; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000042007059&categorieLien=cid

Air Malta employs 333 Cabin Crew. Of these, 188 are on an indefinite term contract, while 145 are on a fixed term contractIn order to save the aforementioned workers, it was agreed to cancel all prior agreements between the cabin crew and the airline held in the 2016 collective agreement. Key to the new agreement signed was that cabin crew agreed to forfeit a guaranteed minimum take-home pay that they previously had a right to, with cabin crew now agreeing to being paid for the number of hours that they worked. Furthermore, it was agreed that whilst crew on indefinite contracts would be allocated with a number of hours of work during the week, those on a definite contract would only be called in (and thus paid) once demand increases.","To date, the measure saved 139 cabin crew on indefinite contracts from redundancy, whilst 145 cabin crew on fixed-term contracts were provided with new contracts.

These include individuals aged 24 or more who have been inactive or unemployed for more than six months, persons over 50 years who do not have a job, and any person who is a registered disabled person under national law and is not in full-time employment. The scheme had originally been in existence between 2015-2019. It was re-opened for a second call in 2020 with more advantageous terms, and some terms and conditions of this scheme needed to be revisited in view of COVID-19. ","The measure aims to support access of individuals including: those who are aged 24 or over who have been unemployed or inactive for the previous 6 months; those unemployed for 12 months and during which they participated in traineeship with the applicant undertaking; those aged 24 and over who have not attained an upper secondary educational or vocational qualification (ISCED 3) and do not have a job; those older than 50 and do not have a job; or any person who is a registered disabled person under national law and is not in full-time employment, amongst others.The Scheme is demand driven and grants are awarded on a first-come first-served basis, subject to the annual ceilings and total budget. The total available budget for the A2E is €12 million, with an indicative annual calendar year ceilings of around €2.4 million. Subsidies provided vary depending on the classification of the employee. Compared to the 2015-2019 scheme, the 2020 scheme provides greater grants for all categories of recruits. During the 2015-2019 call, employers were eligible to receive a subsidy of €85 per week per new recruit engaged, for a period of 26 weeks, 52 weeks or 104 weeks, depending on the target group. In the case of registered disabled persons, a subsidy of €125 per week for a maximum of 156 weeks was provided. In the case of the 2020 subsidy, the amounts provided are €105 and €155 per week, respectively. The second offering of this scheme coincided with COVID-19, consequently Jobsplus clarified that only soft copy applications submitted via email would be accepted, that the scheme could not be used to re-hire those terminated due to redundancies, and that employers could not continue to claim for this subsidy if wages were no longer being incurred due to employees receiving another COVID-19 related benefit (for example the COVID-19 – Person with Disability Benefit or the COVID-19 wage subsidy, both offered by the Government of Malta to prevent redundancies). However, it was clarified that employers could apply to reduce the hours of work of employees within this scheme (generally from 40 hours to 20 hours per week). For this to occur however, employers are to provide a copy of their correspondence with the Director of Employment and Industrial Relations, following which, the A2E will assess the request on a case by case basis and will inform the employer accordingly.","Between 2015 and 2019, 778 unique employers applied for the funding of 2,029 participants. 1,310 of these participants engaged with 573 unique employers, remained active in the scheme with a total of €7.9 million being committed.

Therefore, the consequences of the COVID-19 on Croatian economy should be seen primarily through this economic sector and its spill-over effects on the whole economy. As the share of exports in Croatia's GDP, primarily due to positive trends in tourism, has increased over the last 10 years, so its GDP has become increasingly sensitive to changes in exports. Negative factors, as a sudden decrease in exports, due to an exogenous event like the COVID-19, could have a very fast adverse result in significant GDP decline. Tourism is very sensitive to safety and health because if tourists do not feel safe, they do not travel. Moreover, the tourist sector is experiencing growing recruitment problems. Waiters, chefs, cleaners, and helpers in offices, hotels, and other establishments are needed, but due to the work’s seasonal nature and limited employment possibilities out of season, young people are not willing to enroll in educational programs for these occupations. Further, there is a widespread lack of bakers, pastry-cooks, and confectionery makers. ","Representative trade unions, the Tourism and Services Trade Union of Croatia and Trade Union of Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia on workers’ side, and Croatian Employers’ Association , Catering and Tourism Association, on employers’ side, agreed on 25 March 2020 to suspend the Collective Agreement of Hospitality until the decision of the competent government bodies to terminate outstanding COVID-19 pandemic measures. The main goal is to aid and preserve skilled labour force in the sector, which is essential for the satisfaction of guests. The parties concluded on 8 June 2020, a new agreement that temporary postpones the increase in the level of the minimum and other wages. The parties further agreed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the worker who is temporary not working according to the employer’s decision, is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of at least 50% of his or her basic wage. If the mentioned amount will be lower than the amount of minimal wage, stipulated by the Decree on minimal wage, the worker is eligible on the wage equal to the minimal wage. All other stipulations of the Collective agreement stay on force. Trade Unions accepted the Agreement fully aware that this is the case of special circumstances that employers could not expect or prevent and therefore they are not responsible for them. ","The touristic results in 2020 are much better that expected with around 75% of incoming foreign tourists in comparison with the situation in 2019. However, there is no guarantee for 2021 and therefore such measures can be also applied in the nearly future.

However, the social partners fear that even though there is no formal way of forcing an employee to take a test, employers can still pressure the employee in other ways to undertake a test;* With regard to privacy, such medical information can only be shared between the test agency involved and the employee in question. The employer has no right to acquire information of that nature;* The social partners do not believe that testing alone is sufficient to prevent the spreading of the virus in workplaces. Tests are not 100% conclusive in nature and there is still a relatively high degree of false negatives in test results. In addition, they only provide insight at that moment in time and not even in the near future, if the employee comes in contact with other people.* Finally the social partners plead for a better cooperation and implementation of medical services at work (like occupational physicians) within the general healthcare in the context of contact tracing. Currently, general healthcare and occupational healthcare cooperate too little, leading to inefficiency and errors.","The advice of the High Council on Prevention and Protection at Work is not that concrete that it can be quantified;  neither the advice against testing at the workplace, nor the necessity for improved communication and cooperation between the general medical field and occupational healthcare.",Company / Companies,,No special funding required,"The statement is formulated by the High Council, which consists of both (representative) employers' associations as well as the representative trade unions.

It must also be ensured that sanitary rules are complied with when new teams of subcontractors enter the works;* Place informational posters from the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) in the works, with translation into several languages, according to the nationalities of the workers.* Intensify the action of those responsible for work safety, namely with regard to the promotion, dissemination, inspection and permanent information of all the COVID-19 pandemic prevention procedures.* Keep information up to date for all workers and for all other players on the job, taking into account their legitimate concerns, seeking to support them in solving problems they detect or persist; * Maintain regular communication between workers, companies and other contracting entities, namely on the conditions of hygiene, safety and health in the workplace.**ACCOMMODATION AND HOUSING CONDITIONS:**To guarantee housing and housing conditions for all workers, which ensure the conditions of hygiene and safety for themselves, their families and the communities where they operate, in interconnection with Social Security services and municipal entities.","It is not mentioned, but the proposed measures would cover, should cover all companies and workers in the construction sector.",Trade unions,Sector specific set of companies,No special funding required,"The 40 measures/recommendations proposed are a initiative of the union Federation FEVICCOM taken in June 2020.

In order to support such organisations, the major employer and professional associations in Malta have been conducting research amongst their members to determine the impact of COVID-19. The primary aim of this is to have an up to date picture of the impact upon members and to use this to inform the government whilst also using it to provide direction when drafting policy recommendations. ","Various employer associations have been conducting research amongst their members. The purpose of this data is to inform policy recommendations and for use during lobbying with government and other social partners. The Malta Employers Association (MEA) conducted its third COVID-19 survey amongst its members in September 2020. The survey had three aims:* To evaluate business performance by sector and company size; * To determine employers’ projections for the coming months; * To study the labour market potential in surviving the pandemic. Preliminary findings published by the MEA (September 2020) highlighted that 81% of organisations reported a loss of business since the start of the pandemic, with 45% of respondents reporting a loss of business of 45% or more. Almost half of respondents, however, reported that the situation was better between June and August than it was between March and May. 19% (45 organisations) reported making redundancies between June-August. 65% of organisations also reported that they have employees who are making use of teleworking Other related research has been conducted by the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry (known as the Malta Chamber) as well as by The Malta Chamber of SMEs. Research by the latter (July 2020) highlighted that sales levels, uncertainty, and employee wages were the greatest concerns for SMEs, that 13% of respondents had instigated redundancies due to COVID-19, and that government COVID-19 measures had been generally well received. Surveys have also been conducted by other professional groups that represent employers / self-employed professional workers, such as that conducted by the Chamber of Architects (Kamra tal-Periti).

Amongst the most common reactions were findings that organisations hailing from sectors that had been given less financial support from Government (as they were appraised as a sector that was less badly hit by COVID-19) also required greater support.

In all INA-Group companies, the deadlines for issuing written orders for overtime work are extended from 7 to 30 days. The deadline period for issuing the information concerning a schedule or changed working hours is shortened from 7 days to 24 hours in advance.

This is entirely in accordance with the National Strategy for the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities 2017 – 2020, accepted by the Government of Croatia. In the adverse COVID-19 circumstances, there is a real danger that people with a disability employed in the open labour market will be in particular threat from losing their job, so there was a need to prepare special programme to aid this group.

While the number at the end of January 2020 was 11,203, according to the latest data for June 2020, it was 11,146. This is the result of application of the measure titled 'The support for the preservation of jobs affected by COVID-19' which was implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by co-financing of wage costs. In such measure participated many companies which employ people with a disability in the open labour market but also sheltered workshops and protective workshop units.At the end of June 2020, a special measure the Support for the preservation of jobs in protected workshops, integrative workshops and working units for employment of the people with the disabilities whose functioning is endangered due to the COVID-19 was introduced.

However, due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions, the entry of seasonal workers to Finland has been limited since March 2020. This raised concerns over the negative impact on enterprises in rural areas as they are often dependent on foreign labour force during the summer months. At the same time, large numbers of the domestic labour force working in other sectors has been either temporarily laid-off or unemployed and struggle finding new employment. The Work from Finland – service is a way to connect employers located in the rural areas with unemployed or temporarily laid-off employees often living in urban areas. ","In 2018, the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) established an online service called Work in Finland (in Finnish 'Töitä Suomesta'). Since 2018, employers and job-seekers have been publishing job announcements on the website. It is possible to look for work as an entrepreneur or as a job-seeker (work with an employee-status). The online service has been active since then but it was developed further in Spring 2020 when travel restrictions set due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid increase of labour shortage in the rural areas. MTK together with expert organisation ProAgria and interest organisation Suomen Kylät ry received financing from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to expand and develop the service. The organisations then established TöitäSuomesta Oy, a company that now runs the service Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the service opened a new section where people can assist each other on a voluntary basis. The service now also provides information for employers and job-seekers regarding the complementary services available for them for instance through the public employment services. The service is free of charge for the users. No monetary support is provided. ","By 19 May 2020, 5,500 job-seekers and employers had registered to the service and the website had been visited 80,000 times.

Also they agreed to continue and extend the social dialogue with the other national social partners.","A meeting was held on 16 July 2020 between GSEE and the employers' associations representing the d micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (GSEVEE and ESEE).  As noted in the joint press release, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost immediately following the long-standing crisis, has accelerated the challenges faced by the Greek society. These can only be effectively addressed through social dialogue, synergies and cooperation. Issues such as digitalization and green transformation are raised with a new dynamic, which requires effective intervention and adaptation of all stakeholders. This adjustment is a necessary condition for improving the position of both workers and small and medium-sized enterprises. Cooperation between small-scale entrepreneurship and the valuable resource of human labour can be not only a factor in economic development, promotion of quality employment and social cohesion, but also a means of strengthening democracy and combating inequalities. In this context, the organizations agreed that after the first consultation with the Prime Minister and the Committee on the Plan for the Development of the Greek Economy, the bilateral social dialogue on labour protection and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises will continue with the participation of the other social partners.","This initiative from social partners raises to the possibility of taking joint actions between trade unions and employers organisations, with a focus on protection and support  of SMEs and the workers and to mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 crisis.

The Trade Union of Workers in the Trade Sector (ZSSS-SDTS) tries to take this opportunity for a permanent closure of shops on Sundays. If realized, it would bring an end to a long-lasting public debate on the opening hours of shops on Sundays (for more information see the article [‘Slovenia: Social partners in favour of partial Sunday opening hours in retail’](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/is/publications/article/2018/slovenia-social-partners-in-favour-of-partial-sunday-opening-hours-in-retail). The debate began in 2003 with a referendum which led to a ban on Sunday shopping. However, the referendum decision was never carried out as retail companies’ appeal to the Constitutional Court managed to defer its implementation","With the end of epidemics, the government lifted many restrictions on business activities, but a ban on Sunday shopping remained in place. The Trade Union of Workers in the Trade Sector (ZSSS-SDTS) launched a proposal to transform a temporary ban on Sunday shopping into a permanent one and, in this way, implement a public referendum’s decision from 2003.On the initiative of a trade union, The Left party (Slov. Levica) gave a law amendment into the parliamentary procedure. The draft law seemingly had wide support among parliamentary deputies from the opposition as well as coalition parties. In the mid-July, the draft law successfully passed the discussion in the Parliamentary Committee for the Economy. Only the Modern Centre Party and the government spokesperson openly expressed their concerns that the draft law infringes the entrepreneurial freedom of retailers. However, the second parliamentary reading of the draft law showed that many deputies gave their support in bad faith.In the name of retailers, unsatisfied with the continued prohibition on Sunday opening of shops, the Slovenian Chamber of Commerce appealed to the Constitutional Court. On the ground of this appeal, the government lifted restriction on Sunday opening on 23 July 2020. From then on, all shops are again open on Sundays.The parliament will decide on the draft law in September 2020.

According to this model, workers, mainly employed in sales services and logistics, will be employed full time, 40 hours a week, but will work fewer hours, on average 30 hours a week. Discount retailer Höfer emphasises the benefits for workers from this model, better work-life balance and more time spent with their families. Höfer launched the new employment model with paid advertisements in daily newspapers Delo and Dnevnik on 10 August 2020.","The new employment model targets workers in sales services and logistics. It is important to note that majority of them are already part-time workers, working 30 hours a week on average. Although their payment per hour is high compared to the average payment in the retail sector, these workers receive lower wage and also have lower pension security. Their pension insurance is proportional to part-time employment, so their annual contributions for pension security are equivalent to eight months of full pension insurance and these workers risk old-age poverty. Moreover, researchers point out the problem of a high intensity of work due to which workers carry out the work of eight hours in six hours, but are paid only for six hours (Kanjuo-Mrčela in Ignjatovič, 2018).The new employment model which will requalify part-time employment into full-time employment will solve the problem of partial pension insurance. With the requalification of the employment contract, workers will also receive a full annual holiday allowance. Yet, as all other working conditions will remain the same, the new model does not solve many existing troubles, for instance, the problems of underemployment and high intensity of work. It also raises many open questions – the payment of bonuses for ‘overtime’, the right of workers to second employment as they are in fact part-time employees, full availability of workers to the employer etc.","Discount retailer Höfer will introduce the new employment model with a test period from September to December 2020. In this period, the company will test the reactions of employees and adapt a model if necessary. Until the end of 2020, a quarter of all employees in sales and logistics will be included in the Höfer (full-time) employment model. The transitional period will be concluded by the end of 2021 when more than 1,200 employees (75% of all workers) in sales and logistics are expected to be included in the ‘Höfer (full-time)’ employment model.

Only the trade union campaign forced the competent institutions to take necessary measures for the protection of workers. In June 2020, ZSSS analysed the reasons for the failure of the system and proposed a systemic reform of occupational medicine.","Although most of the production and service workers continued to work since the outbreak of COVID-19, many had no safety equipment on disposal and there were no instructions on safety measures. Experts on occupational medicine, the external support service for employers, were often not available for advising about necessary safety measures at the workplace and undertook actions only after ZSSS’ public campaign. But when they have begun to cooperate, they were only giving general instructions without having inspected the working places to check themselves. In June 2020, ZSSS analysed the reasons for the failure of the system.According to ZSSS analysis, the main reason for its failure was the profit-driven character of occupational medicine. The main financial source for occupational doctors is periodic medical exams for workers paid by employers directly. Existentially dependent on employers, occupational doctors cannot provide independent service in a number of areas, such as occupational diseases, and also failed to properly react during the time of the epidemic. On the grounds of internal analysis, the presidency of ZSSS (a body which consists of 21 representative unions) concluded that occupational medicine should be transformed into a public service working for the benefit and protection of workers. ZSSS announced a campaign for the reform, starting with the presentation of the Economic and Social Council.","ZSSS survey revealed that five per cent of respondents only confirmed the presence of an occupational medicine expert in the company. These experts visited workplaces, checked safety measures by themselves and proposed adaptations. Eleven per cent of respondents said that occupational medicine doctors were available via email or phone. They have begun to cooperate on the initiative of employers.

Contrary to his expectations, the Slovenian Democratic Party of Janez Janša managed to form a new coalition with the two Šarec’s coalition partners. The new right-wing government came into office on 13 March 2020, a day after the outbreak of COVID-19. This caused a two-month halt of the main tripartite body (The Economic and Social Council) in the period when the key ‘anti-corona laws’ (#PKP1 and #PKP2) were adopted.","When Janez Janša’s government took office, it should have appointed its representatives in the Economic and Social Council; instead it was postponed, and, as a result, practically blocked the main tripartite body from 13 March to 30 April 2020 (Podvršič, 2020) from fulfilling its role. As a consequence of the government’s inactivity, social dialogue was practically non-existent in the period when the first two ‘anti-corona laws’ (#PKP1 and #PKP2) were adopted. Trade unions and employer organizations could only send comments on draft laws under great time pressure. They had a day or two to comment on the draft laws in writings but did not receive any response to their inputs and most of their proposals were not taken into consideration in final laws. On 20 April, all seven confederations of trade unions demanded the restoration of social dialogue and the re-establishing of the Economic and Social Council. The government appointed its representatives on 30 April, two days after the adoption of the second ‘anti-corona law’. The first meeting of the Council was held on 15 May 2020.

The trade union underlines the importance to reinforce economic stimulus policies aiming to increase the demand of households, as well as to avoid austerity policies. Measures also emphasise a stabilising effect of social security systems and strong labour legislation. It opposes a privatisation of state services.","The recommendations of the OGBL cover five types of measures:**1. The exit of the crisis**So as to avoid situations of social precariousness and reinforce employment, all crisis-linked derogations from labour law should be stopped. Other recommendations concern the maintaining of the extension of periods of absence due to incapacity of work, employment (leave for family reasons, teleworking for cross border workers, …). Also, specific attention should be paid to gender equity in sectors that are specifically hit by the crisis. **2. Employment retention**Employment retention instruments are aimed to avoid mass unemployment: among them figure the extension of short-time work, access to the minimum social income and its increase. In addition, deadlines for social plans and the reinforcement of social dialogue in enterprises should be considered.**3. The purchasing power of households**OGBL put forward to increase the purchasing power of households by re-examining and increase social benefits such as the indexation of family allowances, the increase of access and amount of rent subsidies, tax credits for vulnerable populations, and the increase of the minimum income. **4. The re-examination of tax measures**OGBL considers that the government must avoid any tax measures that increase the burden on households or reduce the premiums of employees. **5. Financing the crisis**OGBL is not opposed to a new state loan to finance the crisis. Yet, it favours a longer suspension of the budgetary rules at EU level and the creation of a national solidarity fund. Another important point is that the government should not touch the pension fund and pay attention to the financing of the health system.

In the introduction, the employer organisation assesses the four emergency laws for mitigation of the COVID-19 effects. Emergency measures have provided efficient support to people and protection of employment. Not so efficient, according to GZS, has been the financial help provided to companies: as they have problems to fulfil the conditions in order to obtain guarantees and deferred debt instalments, financial instruments are underused.","The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (GZS) positively assessed the government’s plans for investments which may foster economic growth in many activities, particularly in the construction. There are investments needs in the development (knowledge, innovation, digitalisation), the improvement of infrastructure, the transition to a low-carbon society, and housing. GZS identified six domains which should be prioritized:* growth of domestic consumption (energy renovation of buildings, new investments in public buildings);* investments in infrastructure (road, rail, and IT infrastructure system, renewable-energy power plants, 5G investments);* Support to the digitalisation of business enterprises as well as public administration, tax exemptions for investments in digitalisation;  * more investments in research, particularly for the joint projects between research institutions and businesses;* environmental investments (improved waste collection and recycling, the transition to climate-neutral and circular economy, new resources of water):* investments in agriculture, food processing, and food self-sufficiency.GZS estimates that between three and four billion euro could be spent annually for the above-mentioned projects.

According to the Labour Inspectorate, about 2,000 companies reported on workers who worked at home in the past. Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the number has increased to 10,000 companies (involving about 100,000 employees) (Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia - GZS, 11 June 2020). Teleworking will become a more frequent form of work in the future. During the epidemic, when employers had to send workers to work from home, they experienced the rigidity and ambiguities of the current regulation in this respect  (MDDSZ, Instructions, 22 June 2020). Employer organisations are now proposing certain reforms on that topic. ","Employer organisations addressed the initiative for simplifying the regulation concerning the work at home to social partners and the government in particular (for instance, the Association of Employers Slovenia – ZDS, 15 May 2020). On 11 June, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (GZS) organised an informative webinar in which speakers (representatives of the employer organisation, ministry of labour, labour inspectorate, and private business) presented the state of the art and proposals of how to adapt regulations to new needs and necessities. For now, if a worker starts to work at home: * the employer must conclude a new employment contract (because the place of work has changed);* he must inform the Labour Inspectorate;* he must pay compensation to the worker for the material costs (maximum five per cent of the average national salary);* he is fully responsible for the health and safety of workers. The proposal presented at the webinar entails that the law would differentiate between the situation when the worker habitually works at home, and when the worker only occasionally works at home. In the first case, the current legislation would still apply; in the second situation, the employer would only have an obligation to set up rules on health and safety at work, but the worker would be responsible for taking them in the account. Rules on health and safety at work usually encompass requirements on the working environment (lightening, noise, temperature), job post (separate mouse, keyboard and screen at a certain height), flexible office chair on five wheels, determination of working time and rest periods","The proposal explicitly suggests the necessity of legal changes. It is interesting to add that half of all 26 collective agreements include a general clause about work from home. A quarter of them stipulates that the employer and employee can draw an annex to the employment contract on this – a controversial clause as the webinar has shown. Employer organisation GZS expects that more collective agreements are going to include clauses about work from home.

Added tax for food and pharmaceuticals remains 20%.The estimated budget loss from this reduction is estimated at BGN 20 million (€10 million) for a year and a half. In Bulgaria, the standard tax rate for consumption goods is 20%; an exemption make accommodation services with permanent VAT rate of 9%. ","The VAT rate for restaurant and catering services, books and textbooks, baby food and diapers is reduced from 20% to 9% The reduced rate comes into force on 1 July 2020 and will apply until 31 December 2021. The reduced VAT should cover all goods and services offered in restaurants, including certain alcoholic products such as beer and wine.

According to the government, this measure shall help restaurants mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.The measure is implemented as part of a package of measures to support the real sector and the sectors most affected by the crisis. ","Reportedly, the measure was implemented by affected parties immediately after its adoption (10 June 2020), although it should have taken effect at a later stage (1 July 2020). This created controversy between business and government and created chaos in revenue agencies.Public and experts hold the application of VAT reliefs for random. According to the media, in most of the cases, the reduced VAT is not transferred to the final customer. The reduced VAT for restaurant services does not apply for takeaway food, which is still taxed with 20%. This contributes to further public tension, as the measure explicitly supports dining at restaurants in time of COVID-19 pandemic.Restaurants claim that so far their turnover has shrunk by 30% due to the COVID crisis. The summer data of the National Revenue Agency show a minus of 10%. The political condition for a lower VAT was to lighten the sector, but so far there is no visible evidence. The preliminary evaluation of the measure shows results that show that it does not work, as a number of vicious practices are created.In the first two months after the introduction of the lower VAT rate, however, the nominal indirect tax paid was nearly 65% less than in July and August last year, according to the National Revenue Agency (NRA). The sector has become brighter only to the extent that some establishments have raised the insurance of their employees.The situation in the report on the state budget for 2020 shows the same: The fiscal effect on the revenue side is significant, without leading to solving the problems in these sectors, which were highlighted as the main goal for the reduction of VAT.",National government; Employers' organisations; Company / Companies,Sector specific set of companies; Companies providing essential services,No special funding required,"The social partners and experts were not unanimous on the implementation of the measure. The unions were strongly opposed, and employers' organisations were divided. According to the unions, economic policy should be made through the elements of expenditures, not through revenues in the budget. The Confederation of the Unions does not approve differentiated VAT and proposes general VAT decrease from current 20% to 15%. According to the employers, it is not clear why exactly these industries are prioritised, especially since the current government in Bulgaria has repeatedly stated that it will not change the tax system until the end of its term.As of October 2020, representatives of tourist and restaurant businesses evaluate the measure as 'good' as the additional profit made by the tax cut has saved many companies from bankruptcy. Some representatives say that the rise of the social insurance minimum in the industry has led to higher personal costs, but it does not constitute a complaint, as it will give staff more security in case of unemployment due to the COVID-19 containment measures. The Bulgarian Institute for Market Economics warned that the differentiated tax reliefs were introduced without any expert evaluation; and will potentially harm demand equilibrium in many industries. Furthermore, according to the institute, the measure can cause increased risk of circumvention and tax fraud. They categorise the measure as 'political' and not 'economic'.",,,Yes,Only private sector,I55 Accommodation; I56 Food and beverage service activities; J58 Publishing activities; R93 Sports activities and amusement and recreation activities,No,"Food processing, wood working, garment and other craft and related trades workers; Food preparation assistants",,https://parliament.bg/bg/news/ID/5088; https://www.mediapool.bg/parlamentat-namali-stavkata-na-dds-za-restoranti-i-knigi-na-9-news307698.html; https://www.economic.bg/bg/a/view/gerb-razshiri-kraga-ot-dejnosti-s-namaleno-dds-117485; https://ime.bg/bg/articles/preferencii-prez-diferencirani-stavki-na-dds-shte-imat-neblagopriyaten-socialno-ikonomieski-i-fiskalen-efekt-v-srednosroen-i-dylgosroen-plan/; https://news.bg/bulgaria/knsb-iska-namalyavane-na-obshtata-stavka-na-dds-na-15.html; https://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/ikonomika/2020/10/23/4130115_dds_smetkata_molia/; https://www.monitor.bg/bg/a/view/uslugite-na-fitnes-zalite-syshto-s-9-dds-216520; https://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/ikonomika/2020/10/23/4130115_dds_smetkata_molia; https://www.investor.bg/biudjet-i-finansi/333/a/ipi-diferenciraniiat-dds-mina-po-pytia-na-covid-i-zavi-v-nova-posoka-315433

In this case the parties agreed to make it possible to deviate from the applicable notice of termination according to the sector agreement. ","Several important support measures with one purpose only - to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on working and living condition in Denmark - were urgently passed in the parliament when it became clear that several branches in the private sector had to close down in order to avoid further spreading of the coronavirus in the country. They had in common that they were completely new and that the social partners were involved in most of them - in particular measures that aimed at preventing severe employment effects. Thus, the participation of the social partners entirely took place at tripartite level. The social partners did not conclude unilateral or new bipartite agreements with the aim solely to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 at the labour market.However, already existing provisions in the sector agreements were taken up again as a consequence of COVID-19. In this case a right to deviate a provision in the sector agreement stipulating the terms of notice in connection with layoffs. DI and 3F have entered into agreements in a number of collective bargaining areas, which stipulate that companies can layoff/fourlough employees without pay when there is a shortage of work as a result of COVID-19. Most agreements have been extended so that they are valid 29 August, after which they expire. The agreements cover a number of situations in which the company's operations are suspended or undergo a significant decline as a consequence of COVID-19. According to the agreements, the companies do not have to pay wages for the hours that the employees are sent home. When conditions normalise, employees must resume their work. Thus, the agreements should be used as an alternative to a termination due to lack of work in the company. Meanwhile the employees receive unemployment benefits","The agreements on layoffs without pay were extended for a number of agreements, so that they are provisionally valid until and including 29 August 2020.

GB-2020-25/1115,The Confederation of British Industries (CBI) examines the opportunities to accelerate progress to net-zero emissions,A new CBI paper examines the opportunities to accelerate progress to net-zero emissions,United Kingdom,Applies nationwide,06/19/2020,06/19/2020,Temporary,Non-binding recommendations or other texts,Not applicable,"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery",Other,09/14/2020,"In June 2020, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) wrote to the Prime Minister with recommendations as to how to 'Build Back Better' with regard to how the UK can re-build its economy following emergence from lockdown. The CBI stated that this emergence presented an 'opportunity to deliver action that will help deal with a longer-term but just as urgent crisis - climate change.' Thus, central to its recommendations to the Prime Minister was a call to deliver investment into the green economy so as to create new sustainable jobs and infrastructure that support the pressing need to decarbonise society. To support this call, the CBI prepared a paper that outlines the opportunities presented by the emergence from lockdown alongside a set of principles and policy recommendations for government to consider.In summary, the CBI principles are: * The prioritisation of public spending and policy on low-carbon programmes that deliver short-term economic and social benefits and lay the foundations for a resilient, net-zero economy;* Delivery on existing fiscal commitments from the Budget to leverage investment and cut emissions, with the help of the private sector;* For government to look beyond the fiscal remit to drive investment and stimulate a green recovery through smarter regulation and clear policy;* To build the foundations of a green economic recovery from plans to support companies recovering from the pandemic;* For government to coordinate a global response to the climate crisis.The CBI states that these principles, informed by its members, are underpinned by a set of urgent policy actions such as energy efficiency investment to create jobs around the country, support for electric vehicles to maintain the benefits of cleaner air, and developing technologies like carbon capture that will help the UK get to net-zero emissions.","The measure is a set of principles and policy recommendations: thus, there are no eligibility criteria nor any estimation of the proposed measures. The CBI has published the principles and a set of policy recommendations made to the UK government, aimed at the creation of a low-carbon, sustainable and net-zero aligned economic recovery post COVID-19. The paper outlines a set of medium-term priority actions to help policy makers plan the COVID-19 recovery in a way that maximises the benefits and opportunities presented by clean technologies, improved efficiencies, and in-built resilience. The CBI states that its members view the COVID-19 recovery as a real opportunity to do things differently, by delivering the benefits of a low-carbon transition fairly around the country. It sets out principles that build on the range of medium to long-term recommendations made in its 2019 report, 'The low-carbon 2020s: a decade of delivery'.  This report contained a number of priorities to help deliver a coordinated cross-government strategy to deliver net-zero emissions. This remains a priority, and particularly ahead of COP26 next year, there is an urgent need to deliver a shared vision across government on how we will achieve net-zero emissions, including coordinated sector-specific roadmaps, underpinned by a positive environment for investment, regulation that prioritises net-zero, incorporating climate and environmental action into new trade policy, and a focus on delivering a just and fair transition.In summary, the CBI principles are: * The prioritisation of public spending and policy on low-carbon programmes that deliver short-term economic and social benefits and lay the foundations for a resilient, net-zero economy;* Delivery on existing fiscal commitments from the Budget to leverage investment and cut emissions, with the help of the private sector; * For government to look beyond the fiscal remit to drive investment and stimulate a green recovery through smarter regulation and clear policy;* To build the foundations of a green economic recovery from plans to support companies recovering from the pandemic;* For government to coordinate a global response to the climate crisis.For each principle, the CBI outlines an action plan and set of recommendations.","This is a policy paper, which proposes an action plan and recommendations aimed at policy makers.

Countries’ borders were closed, which strongly affected the freight transport. It also had an enormous impact on tourism resulting in almost zero income for passenger transport companies. In Estonia, one of the largest passenger transport company is Tallink Group that operates in passenger water transport sector in Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Latvia. Tallink as well as freight road transport companies made use of the wage subsidy provided by the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, but as the measure was temporary and the difficulties in the sector remain, additional auxiliary measures were needed to keep the business running and retain employment. To keep the businesses afloat and retain employment, changes to collective agreements in the transport sector were made. There are two sector-level collective agreements concluded in the road transport sector – one for passenger transport and the other for freight transport, and there are several collective agreements concluded in water transport between Tallink Group and its subsidiaries and seamen's union.  ","In road transport sector, regarding passenger transport, on 13 January 2020, a new collective agreement for 2020-2023 was signed, which should have increased the wage of bus drivers as of April 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, it was agreed in April that the wage increase would be postponed until June 2020. Regarding freight transport, a collective agreement was signed in 2019 for 2019-2022, according to which the wage of truck drivers should have increased in May 2020. It was agreed, however, that the wage increase would be postponed by a year. In passenger water transport, similar measures were used in Tallink Group by its subsidiaries. In case of service personnel the wage increase was postponed to 2022, but in case of technical personnel the postponement agreement was not reached. Additional changes included different aspects of different agreements. For example, it was agreed that shortening the work days length, changing the calculation periods for banked working time, paying hourly wage instead of daily wages, guaranteeing a gross monthly wage, and making sure the work time is divided as equally as possible. However, additional negotiations are on their way, as the condition for freezing the wage increase was that there would be no redundancies, and if redundancies would take place, the consent to postpone the wage agreement will become null and void. Tallink has now announced the dismissals of more than 1,000 employees, which is enormous number in Estonian context.

It states that this will be achieved through everyone having a decent job, on better pay and working conditions, alongside revitalised public services and a stronger safety net. In line with this, its report on key workers specifically calls for pay increases for key workers to be an integral part of the recovery from the coronavirus lockdown. It points out that the crisis highlighted how much society owes to healthcare staff, care workers, retail and delivery workers, public transport workers, teachers and support staff, energy workers amongst others. As a result, there is strong public support for ensuring key workers are treated fairly.The New Jobs Protection and Upskilling plan is a partial response to the ending of the Government's furlough scheme, due to end in October. The TUC argues that government needs to do more to get people back to work, support jobs and prevent the threat of mass unemployment and that it should learn from experience across Europe. Such support should come with conditions attached and that there is now an opportunity to use this moment to upskill the workforce, prepare for the jobs of the future and build a fairer labour market that offers decent work to everyone.Its key message is that the recovery should encompass the complementary policy goals of creating a fairer labour market and the creation and promotion of decent work.","The reports are essentially policy recommendations to get Britain growing out of the crisis and in so doing, prevent mass unemployment and ensure the creation of decent work. The TUC argues that the pandemic alone did not cause this economic crisis. It was made worse by a decade of austerity and the government’s failure to strengthen the UK’s economy. It avers that choosing the wrong approach to recovery now risks embedding low growth, long-term unemployment and all the social ills that go alongside.Its first report, published in May called for an 'investment for growth approach' and called for action on a number of key areas, including:* Decent work and fairer employment relationships* Sustainable industry with an economic stimulus for a just transition to net zero carbon* Reforms to social security to provide help faster and prevent poverty * The rebuilding of public services, with decent payOn this last point, its later report on decent pay and work for key workers, it called on government to improve the pay of 6 million key workers by increasing the minimum wage and public sector pay, as well as enacting a ban on zero-hours contracts. In September, the TUC published its job protection and upskilling plan, in response to the planned end of the government's furlough/job retention scheme  in October. The TUC argues that the Job Retention Scheme (JRS) has done vital work protecting jobs, supporting 9.6 million people in total,It states that there are some tentative signs of economic recovery but that the threat of mass unemployment is still present, with the Bank of England estimating that unemployment could rise to 7.5% by the end of the year, leaving 2.5 million people out of work. Further, the National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimates that unemployment could reach ten per cent. The TUC thus argues that there is now an opportunity to use this moment to upskill the workforce, prepare for the jobs of the future and build a fairer labour market that offers decent work to everyone. The TUC thus proposes a Jobs Retention Deal and upskilling plan, recommending that: * Government should require businesses to demonstrate they have been hit by coronavirus restrictions in order to qualify for the Jobs Retention Deal* Businesses hit by local lockdowns would automatically qualify for the scheme* The scheme should require workers to be working for a minimum proportion of their normal hours* The scheme should support workers who cannot work because they are in the group previously told to shield or who have caring responsibilities that mean they cannot work* Similar support should be put in place for the self-employed, including those who have lost out on previous support* Workers should continue to receive at least 80 per cent of their pay for time they are not working* Workers earning the national minimum wage should receive 100 per cent of their normal pay* Any worker working less than 50 per cent of their normal working time must be offered funded training* Businesses accessing the scheme must set out Fair Pay Plans* Businesses that access support should set out a plan for decent jobs* Businesses that access support should pay their Corporation Tax in the UK* Businesses accessing the scheme should commit to keep people in work and not pay dividends while using the scheme.","The report itself is publicly available on the TUC's website; no evaluation data is available with regard to how many times it has been downloaded etc. These are policy recommendations, not actual measures that have been implemented. Thus, there is no comment to be made on the scale of support provided, eligibility criteria etc.The action plans will underpin the TUC's campaigning work around economic recovery but of course, these are just policy recommendations not implemented actions. Thus, it is impossible to state how many workers, citizens etc will be affected in future.",Trade unions,,Trade union,It can be assumed that there would be broad support from other trade unions.

They have been praised as essential service workers and people applauded them in public. But their remuneration is a matter of long standing concern. Public employers play a role in elderly care; the sector is dominated by not-for-profit organsiations and, increasingly, by private employers. Collective bargaining coverage of private companies is very low; a sectoral collective agreement covering private care homes is not in place. A decade ago, government obliged public, not-for profit employers and private business organisations to take part in a statutory sectoral minimum wage commission for at least settling a nation-wide minimum wage for assistant care workers. In fall, several social welfare organisations set up a new employer organisation, BVAP, for settling a multi-employer agreements that is extended by the federal labour minister.

In consequence, the funding of the premium became a matter of public policy debate between the federal minister for health and the public health insurance funds. In the Second Act on Protection in the COVID-19 crisis from May 2020, government stipulates that all workers - including assistant and auxiliary workers - in elderly care have a right to a COVID-19 premium of €1,000 maximum. Full-time workers shall receive €1,000, part timers shall receive less depending on the hours worked. Employers do not have to pay the premium during the crisis as the public care insurance fund will provide an advance payment of €1,000 for each worker.

","Administered by the Malta Enterprise, the measure provided organisations with a cash grant (and the possibility of an additional tax grant) not exceeding 80% of the eligible costs to support organisations to carry out investment projects to increase or initiate production of COVID-19 relevant products or to diversify existing production to be able to produce COVID-19 relevant products. Costs need to have been incurred after 1 February 2020 and investments need to be completed within a period of six months. The grant can be increased by an additional 15% if the project is completed within two months or if the organisation is carrying out the project in collaboration with another organisation established in another Member State which is also providing funding. Amongst the supported investments are: * assets procured to develop, manufacture and provide COVID-19 relevant products; wage costs of individuals engaged in the development of tools, processes and solutions for the manufacturing of relevant products; wage costs for those developing data collecting and processing tools supporting issues related to COVID-19; * costs incurred for trial runs of the new (or diversified) production facilities such as cost of materials required for trial runs of production facilities and cost of data sets acquired to test data processing and collection solutions.","This incentive has a cash budget of €10,000,000 and a fiscal budget to be awarded as tax creditof €1,500,000.

FR-2020-16/1169,Agreement on social support for the crisis linked to COVID-19 within the Safran group,Accord relatif à l'accompagnement social de la crise liée au COVID-19 au sein du groupe Safran,France,Applies nationwide,04/15/2020,10/31/2020,Temporary,Bipartite collective agreements,New aspects included into existing measure,Income protection beyond short-time work,Income support for unemployed,09/22/2020,"On 15 April 2020, the aircraft supplier Safran has signed an agreement with the three representative unions CFDT, CFE-CGC and FO to deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic. With the aim of _'ensuring equity and strengthening solidarity between employees'_, the text aims to define measures to support the implementation of short-time working (partial activity) _'during the coming weeks, until the gradual resumption of all activities under the previous conditions'_. This text provides in particular for the creation of a solidarity fund to provide additional compensation for short-time workers receiving less than €2,500 gross per month.","**Creation of a solidarity fund**The agreement specifies that employees on short-time working whose working time is calculated in terms of the number of days in the year and not on the basis of weekly working hours (employees under 'forfait-jours) and those with no hourly reference are entitled to full net pay in accordance with the metalworkers' collective agreement. Also, in accordance with 'a principle of solidarity between the different categories of employees', the agreement sets up a solidarity fund intended to guarantee, for the months of April and May, additional compensation for all employees on short-time working who do not benefit from full maintenance of the above-mentioned pay. This guarantee makes it possible to increase the gross hourly wage by 1% to 8% per hour declared as short-time working, depending on the level of pay: for employees receiving less than €2,200 gross per month, the increase is 8%. For those paid between €2,410 and €2,500 euros, the increase is 1%. This fund will be fed, until 10 June 2020, via :* the deduction of one day's leave for employees in forfait-jours basis and employees without hourly reference (whose pay is maintained at 100% as indicated above), with more than three months' seniority as at 31 March 2020 and at least 30% short-time working in April;* the possibility for employees, 'including members of management', to pay voluntary days off.In the event that the solidarity fund does not allow for the full financing of these measures, the scale would be reduced 'in due proportion'. If there is a surplus, the signatories agree to meet to define the terms and conditions for revising the scale.* The agreement adds that the partial period of activity will have no impact on the calculation of the 13th month and on the calculation of the retirement indemnity due for the year 2020.**Adjustment of paid holidays**The agreement takes into account Order No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, which allows for the terms and conditions for taking paid holidays to be adapted. Group companies will thus be able, until 31 October 2020, to impose the taking of paid leave, up to a limit of six working days per employee. Holidays must be taken in the following order of priority:* days of paid leave acquired during the previous vesting period;* days of acquired leave provided for by collective agreements (seniority leave, etc.);* days of paid leave acquired during the last vesting period, which may lead, where applicable, to taking early leave.The unilateral fixing of paid leave by the employer shall be subject to a notice period of at least two working days during the confinement period and at least five working days outside the confinement period. These advance notice periods apply 'for fixing the days of leave taken in rotation or collectively in the context of a closure'.The signatories also provide for the possibility of modifying the dates of leave already set until 31 October 2020, still within the limit of six working days.The employer must inform the Social and Economic Committee (work council) of its decisions by any means and as soon as possible.However, employees are entitled to a leave of at least two consecutive weeks within the legal period for taking leave. In addition, the employer must ensure that paid leave is taken during the summer period in order to ensure the employee's right to paid leave with his family.**Other guarantees**The agreement sets out other measures to mitigate the implementation of the Short-time working, in particular:* the maintenance at 100% of the remuneration of employees on apprenticeship and work-study contracts and the remuneration of trainees during the period of confinement;* neutralisation of the impact of partial activity on the calculation of incapacity, invalidity and death benefits. The reference remuneration to be taken into account will be that of the calendar month preceding the partial activity.** Health and safety**In addition, in order to 'ensure the proper application and respect, within the company, of the rules of hygiene, safety and social distancing', Safran recommends, 'when possible', the setting up, on the sites, of employees with a mission of ""sentinel for prevention, according to operating methods defined locally.","The agreement applies to about 44,100 employees in France.",Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment; Workers in non-standard forms of employment; Youth (18-25) in employment,Companies; Employees; Employer; National funds,"The three representative trade unions (the CGT has not signed it) that represent the majority of the votes at the last workplace elections, have signed the agreement and support the measures.",,,Yes,Only private sector,C30 Manufacture of other transport equipment,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041755940; https://www.metallurgie-cfecgc.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/Accord%20national%20du%203%20avril%202020%20portant%20sur%20les%20modalités%20d%27organisation%20du%20travail%20pour%20faire%20face%20à%20l%27épidémie%20de%20covid-19%20-%20signé.pdf

The CGT is not a signatory. This framework agreement, which covers all the French sites of the third largest European meat process manufacturer, applies to 13,000 employees. It should make it possible both to enhance, throughout the crisis, the commitment of employees, whose activity is essential, and to manage the under-activity of certain establishments. It also sets out the procedures for informing employee representative bodies throughout the crisis.","The agreement underlines that a significant drop in activity will affect certain services, workshops or establishments. This situation is due to the cancellation of orders, supply difficulties, or the impossibility of maintaining an activity _'due to the failure of service providers or absenteeism'_. If setting up work-study teams or internal mobility measures are not enough to address this situation of underemployment, the agreement proposes the mobilisation of 'hours and days off counters'. **Measures to avoid recourse to partial unemployment**At the sites, the management can use the following four devices in the order of priority set by the group agreement. These are:* the modulation of working hours, for workers and employees, with the setting of the schedule within the lower limit of 35 hours ;* asking managers and supervisors to take days granted as part of agreements on the reduction of working hours;* the use of rest days deposited in a time-saving account;* the taking of paid holidays.Each system is implemented with a 24-hour notice period. The first three tools can be used within an overall limit of ten days. Paid holidays may be taken for up to five working days.Recourse to short-time working is envisaged as a last resort. The deployment of partial activity, whether in the form of reduced working hours or the closure of an establishment, must be validated and then monitored by senior management.**Management of essential skills**According to the agreement, it is necessary to develop the skills essential to the continuity of the group's ""vital"" activity. Indeed, the ""novel"" measures made necessary by the health crisis are disrupting personal life. In addition, the ""barrier"" measures implemented by the employer have a significant impact on the organisation of services and workshops. This valorisation of skills is primarily based on an increase in the internal professional mobility bonus paid for each day of mobility (increase of €10 per day).Another counterpart provided for in the agreement concerns the remuneration of overtime worked from 16 March to 26 April. Employees who wish to do so, for any hours worked between 35 and 42 hours, are offered the option of benefiting from the social and tax regime for overtime and a 25% pay rise, rather than having them managed under the usual working time modulation scheme. The pay increase is increased to 50% for hours worked beyond 42 hours.The agreement specifies that the succession of busy weeks must remain under control. Management may refuse to allow certain essential employees to take paid leave. The taking of the fifth week's holiday can be postponed beyond 31 May 2020.**Information for employee representatives**The agreement organises information for the Information and consultation bodies at the level of each establishment. It covers the implementation of each work organisation measure applied within the framework of this agreement. It is specified that recourse to short-time working is the subject of information and consultation with the establishment's social and economic committee. At group level, management will inform the trade union coordinators (the shop-steward of the representative unions at group level) at weekly telephone briefings. The exchange will enable, in particular, the monitoring of the group's activity levels and absenteeism. It provides for a 'specific focus' in the event of partial activity.","This framework agreement, which covers all the French sites of the third largest European meat process manufacturer, applies to 13,000 employees on national level and 28 slaughterhouses.",Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,No special funding required,The three representative trade unions support the measures included in the agreement as the signed it.,,,Yes,Only private sector,C10 Manufacture of food products,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000041755956; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041755940

FR-2020-23/1178,Agreement relating to the setting up of a specific partial activity system within the Bosch France group,Accord relatif à la mise en place d’un dispositif spécifique d’activité partielle au sein du groupe Bosch France,France,Applies nationwide,06/01/2020,06/30/2022,Temporary,Bipartite collective agreements,Entirely new measure ,Employment protection and retention,Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work),09/24/2020,"On 17 July 2020, in order to avoid reducing its workforce at several sites in France, the Bosch industrial group concluded an agreement on the [long-term partial activity scheme (DSAP)](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/FR-2020-27_1030.html) with all the employee trade union organisations (CFDT, CFE-CGC, CGT, FO and SUD). The group was one of the first in France to introduce this new short-time working arrangement. It will apply until 30 June 2022 to all employees of the Bosch Group in France. Employees may be placed in partial activity up to a limit of 40% of their working time, with remuneration of 90% of their net salary. The Group undertakes, at the time of each request to the administration for a transfer into the scheme, not to make any redundancies for economic reasons.","The specific partial activity system (DSAP) may be set up at the group's various sites. Depending on business constraints, the reduction in working hours may not exceed 40% of working time. The volume of hours concerned will be assessed 'employee by employee' over the duration of the request for partial activity within the establishment or company concerned, unless an exception is made (for example, in the case of a qualifying training course). A provisional schedule for the use of the partial activity scheme will be presented to the social and economic committee (CSE) for the duration of the request for partial activity. An indicative percentage of recourse to the scheme will be defined. At each ordinary meeting of the ESC, the half-yearly forecast will be updated. Non-nominative but individualised lists, employee by employee, will also be presented, with the hours worked.** Compensation for reduced activity** Legally, the agreement recalls, the amount of the partial activity allowance paid to the employee is set at 70% of gross pay, i.e. approximately 84% of net pay. In the agreement, the management undertakes to increase the amount of the partial allowance as follows:* Pending validation of the agreement by the administration and due to the summer period, management has applied, for the hours not worked in July, a maintenance of 90% of the net monthly salary, i.e. 75% of the gross monthly salary, except for Forfait-jours employees (i.e. those whose working hours are expressed in days worked over a year), who benefit from the maintenance of 100% of the net monthly salary.* Since 1 August, this maintenance of 90% of net monthly pay has applied to all employees, including those on ""forfait-jours"" contracts.The agreement states that, if the employee so wishes, it may use a rest day to replace a day of partial activity, in order to avoid loss of pay or loss of holiday pay (the time savings account being closed in the event of partial activity).The management undertakes to neutralise non-worked hours for the calculation of certain bonuses (half-yearly bonus, precariousness bonus for fixed-term contracts), the distribution of profit-sharing and incentive schemes and for the calculation of the CSE's budgets.**A commitment to maintaining employment**In view of the economic uncertainties' affecting the group's various activities, the company or establishment that will use this system will undertake at each request to the administration, for a maximum period of six months, not to make any redundancies for economic reasons or ""rupture conventionnelle collective"" (which allows for voluntary collective redundancies), except in the case of procedures already under way.**A commitment to training**In addition, periods of low activity can be an opportunity to implement training actions aimed at enabling employees to maintain and develop their skills and qualifications. Each company or establishment using the DSAP will offer each employee who is only partially active in the company or establishment training courses, with training being paid at 100% of net pay for the hours concerned. This training request may involve the mobilisation of the training personal account (CPF), as specified in the agreement.**Implementation of the agreement**The agreement sets out the 'general principles to be respected' for applications for DSAP. The administrative process must begin after the social and economic committee of the company or establishment has been informed and consulted, in particular on the diagnosis of the economic situation and the practical arrangements for implementing the DSAP. The agreement specifies that a monthly monitoring of the agreement will be carried out between two representatives per signatory union organisation and management, in particular to identify any difficulties in its application.","The German group Bosch, which has 400,000 employees worldwide, employed 6,600 people in France at the end of 2019.

","Support for re-employment is a measure that seeks to support companies’ ability to employ people. The maximum amount of support is €1,000 per employee. This measure covers employees whose salary has been paid by the employer after the expiry of the restriction and for a period of three months and has totaled to at least €2,500. Support for re-employment may be granted to cover at least 2,500 companies that employ up to 800 people.Companies that have received other forms of financial support may apply but it may decrease the final amount. Companies need to apply for this support measure at Keha Centre. ","As of 31 August 2020, in total 2,242 companies had applied for support. The number of companies that had been granted support was 598 and the number of rejected applications was 102. In total €5,240,000 had been paid out to companies. ",National government,Sector specific set of companies,National funds,"According to Service Union United PAM, continuation of the employment should be set as a requirement of eligibility for this measure. Otherwise, companies could apply first apply for this support and then dismiss newly recruited employees. Another point of criticism is the exclusion of agency workers. Even the employers’ organisation MaRa has critisised the exclusion of agency workers. In addition, they argue that the amount paid out to companies should not be dependent on the number of employees but financial losses the restrictions on activities caused.

Along the way it has been adapted to best suit the situation and the phase the country is currently in (for example, it is now mostly aimed at companies/sectors that are still heavily struck). The latest addition is a new specific form of temporary unemployment that is guaranteed to parents in case the school of their children is forced to close due to the virus and the accompanying measures. ","Currently, if a child has to be quarantined after contact with an infected person the parents are allowed to make use of the temporary unemployment scheme to care of their child (which allows them to stay at home and removes the wage cost from the employer).What has not yet been regulated is the situation in which a child has to be preventively quarantined because the school or after/pre school care (or part of it) is closed due to a an outbreak (or possible outbreak) of the virus. These situations are often very difficult for parents as it forces them to search for care on very short notice. The new measure that is proposed by the newly formed government arranges that parents can opt to make use of temporary unemployment in these situations (given they have the proper certificate from the school or care unit).

The Procedure provided for State-compensated tourism services for medical staff in Lithuania. Thus, on one hand, the objective is to thank healthcare professionals for their critical role during the COVID-19 crisis and, on the other hand, to contribute to the promotion of tourism in Lithuania, given that the tourism sector is one of the most seriously affected by this pandemic.","The Procedure stipulates that employees of Lithuanian healthcare institutions will be able to use tourism services worth €200 from 1 September 2020 until 30 November 2020, and the cost of such services will be reimbursed by the State. Purchased services shall be provided in the territory of Lithuania only.In order to use tourism services compensated by the State, healthcare professionals shall contact a licensed tourism service provider (accommodation provider, local tour operator, travel agent or seller of travel packages) whose tourism services are to be purchased.The value of State-compensated tourism services per healthcare employee is €200 (incl. VAT). If the price for tourism services chosen by a healthcare employee is higher, he/she shall cover the difference at his/her own expense. If the price for tourism services is less than €200, the unused part is not compensated.","A total of 64,000 healthcare employees will be able to access tourism services compensated by the State, including almost 44,000 licensed physicians and over 20,500 unlicensed healthcare employees, a list of whom was drawn up by all Lithuanian municipalities.

In particular, looking at how individuals with disabilities have been supported during the COVID-19 crisis, the sector association the Royal Dutch Transport Association (KNV, consisting of enterprises in the sector of health care transport and taxis), developed a protocol for health related transport for individuals over the age of 18 and a protocol for those under the age of 18. This specifies how enterprises and workers offering health related transport (often in the context of social services) can continue to carry out their work safely so that individuals who cannot use regular public transport can remain mobile. For individuals with a disability this is an important part of general social inclusion and in some cases, in accessing employment as well.","Several straightforward rules about regular taxi- and care transport during COVID-19 were published by the Dutch government.  According to these rules all passengers should be advised to only use the transport when absolutely necessary. These rules include keeping distance from the passenger as much as possible. Those who need assistance are expected to get a member of their household to do it, unless they are in a wheelchair in which case the professional will help them in accordance with the safety protocols. The KNV published a sector protocol to which the Dutch government refers for detailed guidance. The document contains a detailed description of what is and is not allowed, however, it is important to note that it allows for flexibility to account for certain issues. For example, if someone cannot wear a facemask due to their illness or disability they are not required to. However, in that case the driver keeps 1.5 meter distance from the person. A driver cannot accompany someone into an institution, however where necessary they may accompany them to the door. Different issues have been addressed in this manner.

This form of support replaced the two forms of business development aid that companies could previously get either from the public provider for innovation funding, Business Finland, or from the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY Centres). Unlike funding from Business Finland and ELY Centres that could be used to develop companies and find ways to adapt to the new market situation, business cost support is a form of funding that is intended to cover fixed costs that are difficult to adjust.The legal basis for this support is Laki yritysten määräaikaisesta kustannustuesta (508/2020) (unofficial translation: Act on fixed-term business cost support). The application process is administrated by the State Treasury (in Finnish 'Valtionkonttori').The application period was open between 7 July 2020 and 31 August 2020. The support period is April 2020.","This form of support is available for businesses whose turnover has decreased at least by 30% as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and that have costs that are difficult to adjust.This form of support is available for companies whose total turnover for the reference period (March 2019 to June 2019) is at least €20,000. It cannot be granted if the amount of support to be paid is less than €2,000.Eligibility is tied to sectors that have experienced at least 10% decrease in the overall turnover.  Exceptions can be made on serious grounds.The minimum amount for the support is €2,000 per company. The maximum amount is €500,000. The amount of support is based on the company's turnover, the level of fixed costs as well as payroll costs. The amount is dependent on the company's turnover either in April 2020 or the average turnover of April 2020 and May 2020.Companies that have applied or received other type of financing may apply for business cost support but this may affect the amount.The total budget for this measure is €300 million.","According to [the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment](https://valtioneuvosto.fi/documents/1410877/16402203/Korona_tilannekuva_TEM_1.9.2020-final.pdf/38cb4dae-0e83-db97-7c37-3cbb77086acd/Korona_tilannekuva_TEM_1.9.2020-final.pdf?), approximately 12,800 businesses had applied for this support as of 31 August 2020 (the day the application closed). The number companies that had been granted this support was approximately 8,500.The most significant sector (in terms of number of companies applying) was gambling and betting services, followed by accommodation services and travel agency, tour operator and other reservation service and related activities.The amount of support that had been paid out to businesses was €107 million.Update 30 June 2021: According to [the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment]( https://tem.fi/tilannetietoa-yritysrahoituksesta-koronatilanteessa), the total amount granted for companies during the first three application rounds has been around €445 million. This is significantly lower than the total budget of these rounds – around €1 billion. One of the factors that may have contributed to this difference between the granted amount and the amount available is the high rejection rate, at least during the second application round. [Helsingin Sanomat](https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000007722017.html) reported that during the first weeks of the second application round, around 70% got a rejection. The most common reason is that their turnover had not decreased 30% or more during the support period which is a criteria for eligibility.In 2021, the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs published [an assessment]( https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/163026/TEM_2021_26.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) (in Finnish) of the effectiveness of the direct financial subsidies, including business cost support. The results indicate that the direct subsidies seem to have had a positive impact on the beneficiaries’ turnover (1% impact for €10,000) support. Business cost support seems to have had the strongest effect. The subsidies seem to also had effect on companies payroll (0,5% for €10,000). In addition, the subsidies have diminished the probability of temporary lay offs (0,5% decrease per €10,000 support). The impact on the probability to permanently lay off has not been as clear. Furthermore, the positive effect of the subsidies is linked to relatively small amount of support (under €200,000).",National government,,National funds,"The Confederation of Finnish Industries (in Finnish 'Elinkeinoelämän keskusliitto') argues that while there are many positive aspects to the business cost support, there are also some significant flaws. The key points of concern are limiting the maximum amount a company can receive, the low overall budget of the measure and limiting this measure to certain sectors.The Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) has criticised the business cost support. Their key argument is that a financial support that is paid out afterwards does not support employment in the best possible way. Instead, the support should be directed to future investments such as research, business development and employment.",,,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://valtioneuvosto.fi/documents/1410877/16402203/Korona_tilannekuva_TEM_1.9.2020-final.pdf/38cb4dae-0e83-db97-7c37-3cbb77086acd/Korona_tilannekuva_TEM_1.9.2020-final.pdf?t=1599040943409; https://www.valtiokonttori.fi/en/service/business-cost-support/; https://ek.fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/2020/06/08/ek-huolissaan-yleisen-kustannustuen-riittavyydesta/; https://www.valtiokonttori.fi/en/universal/frequently-asked-questions-about-business-cost-support/; https://valtioneuvosto.fi/-/1410877/kaikkien-toimialojen-yritykset-voivat-hakea-kustannustukea-ehtona-liikevaihdon-lasku-koronan-vuoksi?languageId=en_US; https://tem.fi/-/lakiesitys-eduskuntaan-kustannustuen-kolmas-hakukierros-alkaa-huhtikuussa-yksinyrittajat-mukana-tuessa?languageId=en_US; https://valtioneuvosto.fi/-/1410877/lakiluonnos-lausunnoille-kustannustuesta-uusi-hakukierros-myos-suurille-yrityksille-valmisteilla-korvaus-asiakastilojen-sulkemisesta?languageId=en_US; https://tem.fi/tilannetietoa-yritysrahoituksesta-koronatilanteessa; https://www.sak.fi/ajankohtaista/blogi/kustannustuki-ongelmallinen-tapa-tukea-tyollisyytta; https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/163026/TEM_2021_26.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

It is framed by a wider package of active labour market policies, the programme 'ATIVAR.PT - Enhanced Support Programme to Employment and Vocational Training ;(ATIVAR.PT — Programa Reforçado de Apoios ao Emprego e à Formação Profissional). This Programme aims to ensure an adequate and rapid response with support programmes for hiring and internships, in combination with programmes for specific sectors and groups.It includes two policy measures: a) ATIVAR.PT Internships; b) ATIVAR.PT Incentive. The Ordinance 206/2020, of 27 August, regulates the measure ATIVAR.PT Internships, which aims at strengthening the supports to the integration of young people in the labour market and the vocational retraining of the unemployed, notably those with disability or impairment (article 3, number 1 d).","The objectives of the measure ATIVAR.PT Internships are to (article 2): 1. Complement and develop the unemployed skills, notably unemployed young people, in order to improve their employability profile, through practical experience in work context;2. Support the transition between the qualifications system and the labour market, namely by promoting the integration in the active life of young people with adequate levels of qualification;3. Promote knowledge about new trainings and skills among businesses; and promote job creation in new areas;4. Support the improvement of qualifications and the conversion of the productive structure. This measure is addressed to all unemployed persons registered at the PES. However, specific conditions apply to some groups, including to those with disabilities or impairments (article 3, number 1 d), for instance: The promoter entity that integrates trainees with disability or impairment will see the internship duration extended for more three months, from 9 to 12 months (article 8). Every trainee with disability or impairment is entitled to: a monthly internship grant, meal or meal allowance, transportation between his/her residence and the location where the internship will take place or transportation allowance, and insurance against accidents at work (article 11).The monthly internship grant is granted per participant according to his/her level of qualification ranging between 1.2 times the Social Support Index (Indexante dos Apoios Sociais – IAS) (the amount of IAS in 2020 is €438.81) for qualification level 3 of the National Qualifications Framework (Quadro Nacional de Qualificações - QNQ) and 2.4 times the IAS for qualification level 8 of the QNQ. For the remaining situations a monthly amount equivalent to the IAS is granted.The Institute for Employment and Vocational Training (Instituto do Emprego e Formação Profissional, IEFP, IP) contributes between 65% and 95% of the monthly internship grant, depending on specific conditions (article 15). This contribution will be increased by 15 percentage points if the trainee is a person with disability or impairment.The IEFP also contributes to the meal allowance, transportation and insurance against accidents at work (article 15).The promoter entity that concludes an open-ended employment contract with the trainee, within a maximum period of 20 working days from the date of the end of the internship, is entitled to a job-creation award.

It is part of a wider package of active labour market policies, the 'Programme ATIVAR.PT - Enhanced Support Programme to Employment and Vocational Training' (ATIVAR.PT — Programa Reforçado de Apoios ao Emprego e à Formação Profissional), which aims to ensure an adequate and rapid response with support programmes for hiring and internships, in combination with programmes for specific sectors and groups. It includes two policy measures: a) ATIVAR.PT Internships; and b) ATIVAR.PT Incentive.The Ordinance 207/2020, of 27 August, regulates the measure ATIVAR.PT Incentive, a support to the hiring of unemployed people oriented to the creation of sustainable employment and to the promotion of the employability of groups who are more distant from the labour market.This measure introduces reinforced incentives to stimulate the hiring of unemployed people with low employability, notably those with a disability or impairment, while providing for a set of transitional mechanisms to respond to the new unemployed and to adapt to the exceptional context that the country is experiencing.","The objectives of the measure ATIVAR.PT Incentive are (article 2): 1. Prevent and combat unemployment;2. Encourage and support net job creation;3. Encourage the professional integration of specific groups with higher difficulties in the integration into the labour market;4. Promote the improvement and quality of employment, encouraging more stable employment relationships;5. Encourage the creation of jobs located in inland areas in order to reduce regional disparities.'ACTIVAR.PT Incentive' adresses people with disabilities and/or impairments as detailed below. This incentive corresponds to a financial support to the employer that concludes an employment contract with an unemployed registered for at least six months at the PES (transitory and until 30 June 2021, this period has been reduced to three months), who matches specific conditions (article 6). This mandatory period of registration at the PES is not required when the unemployed has a disability or impairment.The private for profit or not for profit employer must meet the following requirements (article 3):* Being regularly constituted and registered;* Having completed the legal requirements required for the exercise of the activity or present proof of having started the applicable process;* Having the tax and contributory situation up-to-date;* Not being in non-compliance with regard to financial supports granted by IEFP, I. P .;* Having complied with the rules regarding funds in the context of the European Social Fund financing;* Having organised accounting in accordance with the law;* Not having delayed salary payments;* Not having been convicted for a criminal or administrative offense due to violation of labour legislation, notably regarding discrimination at work and access to employment, in the last three years, unless the sanction applied in the context of this process results in a longer term.The granting of financial support requires the maintenance of the job for at least 24 months, in the case of an open-ended contract, or the initial contract duration, in the case of a fixed-term contract (article 9).The employer is obliged to provide vocational training to the hired worker, in one of the following modalities (article 10, paragraph 1):1. Work-related training adjusted to the skills of the job, for a minimum period of 12 months, monitored by a tutor selected by the employer;2. Work-related training adjusted to the skills of the job, in a certified training entity, with a minimum workload of 50 hours, carried out, whenever possible, during the normal working hours.The employer is entitled to financial support corresponding to (article 11):1. 12 times the value of the Social Support Index (Indexante dos Apoios Sociais – IAS), in the case of open-ended contract;2. 4 times the value of the IAS, in the case of a fixed-term contract.The amount of the IAS in 2020 is €438.81.This financial support is increased by 10% notably in the case of hiring unemployed persons with disabilities or impairment. The financial support is also increased when the job is located in inland areas; and when the person hired belongs to the under-represented sex in that occupation.The employer that converts, under this Ordinance and respecting specific requirements, a fixed-term contract into an open-ended contract is entitled to a ‘conversion award’. The amount of this award is equal to twice the monthly basic wage defined in the contract, up to the limit of five times the value of the IAS (€2,194.05) (article 12, paragraph 1); transitory, until 30 June 2021, this amount is equal to three times the monthly basic wage defined in the contract, up to the limit of seven times the value of the IAS (€3,071.67).",This measure was launched very recently.

Companies with an operating license under the Amusement and / or Cable Car Act have costs associated with statutory maintenance that cannot be scaled down in the short term, and the government therefore regards charity costs as fixed, unavoidable costs for these companies.

To facilitate the approval of liquidity loans at favorable terms and conditions in cooperation with commercial banks and to speed up the recovery of as many entrepreneurs as possible whose operations have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 (coronavirus), necessary guarantees in the form of portfolio insurance policies (guarantees) are offered for loans intended for exporters and the tourism industry.","Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR) for and on behalf of the Republic of Croatia, approves portfolio insurance policies (guarantees) to commercial banks and to HBOR for new liquidity loans for solving the problems caused by consequences of the pandemic COVID 19. Insurance policies (guarantees) are used as collateral for new liquidity loans approved to exporters, and as a new measure, HBOR has also enabled exporters from the tourism sector to use this benefit. This manner of insurance is available for use by indirect exporters (suppliers of exporters). Insurance policies (guarantees) allow entrepreneurs to obtain new liquidity loans more easily and more quickly with less collateral requirements. The guarantee covers a maximum of 90% of the principal of an individual loan.

GB-2020-45/1234,The new Jobs Support Scheme,The new Jobs Support Scheme,United Kingdom,Applies nationwide,11/01/2020,05/01/2021,Temporary,Other initiatives or policies,Entirely new measure ,Employment protection and retention,Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work),10/03/2020,"With the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme (CJRS) due to finish at the end of October and restrictions being re-imposed on parts of the country, concerns were mounting about the  combined impact these would have on employment levels. Even before the latest economic and social restrictions, official forecasts were projecting a possibility of joblessness shooting up to four million by early next year.  As such, pressure was mounting for the government to act. Thus, in a speech to the House of Commons on 24 September, the Chancellor outlined his Winter Economy Plan; central to this was the new Jobs Support Scheme, which is essentially a short-hours working subsidy, similar to the German Kurzarbeit scheme.","The new scheme will run for six months from the 1 November. Essentially, the government will contribute towards the wages of employees who are working fewer than normal hours. In order to qualify (at least for the first three month of the scheme, the employee must work at least 33% of their usual hours - the government will review whether to increase the threshold after three months of the scheme's operation).  Employees will be able to “cycle on and off” the scheme and do not have to work the same pattern each month. However, each short-time working arrangement must cover a minimum period of seven days.For the hours actually worked, employers will continue to pay the employee's usual wages. However, for every hour not worked, the government and the employer will each pay one third of the equivalent salary. The government’s contribution will be capped at GBP 697.92 a month; much lower than the cap on the original furlough scheme of GBP 2,500. Because of the requirement to work at least a third of usual hours, the scheme will cover the wages for a maximum of 66.6% of hours not worked. This means that the government contribution is worth 22% of full pay, whilst the employer contribution will be 55%.  As a result – taking together pay for full hours worked, and state and company subsidised wages for down time – employees using the scheme will receive at least 77% of their usual pay (unless it is cut down by the government cap of GBP 697.92).Regarding eligibility, employees under the scheme must not be on a redundancy notice, in a step designed to encourage companies to retain staff. Indeed, the scheme is designed to complement the government’s jobs retention bonus, announced by the Chancellor in his summer economic update. Under this scheme, businesses receive a one-off payment of GBP 1,000 for every previously furloughed employee they still employ at the end of January 2021.The new scheme will be open to all employers with a UK bank account and part of PAYE. All small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be eligible. However, large businesses must show their business has been adversely affected by COVID-19, with such companies needing to demonstrate that turnover has fallen by a third. The government also stated that it expected that large employers would not pay dividends to shareholders while using the scheme.The scheme is in part designed to save Government money. The Chancellor outlined in his speech that a worker on the furlough scheme gets GBP 1,400 a month on average. In comparison however, if that same person was on the job support scheme, the maximum amount of government support they would get would be GBP 300 per month. If a million workers are covered by the new scheme, the Chancellor stated, it would cost the exchequer GBP 300 million per month, whereas the furlough scheme has cost almost GBP 40 billion since its launch in March. However, concerns have been voiced as to the scheme's exclusion of workers at companies forced to close because of coronavirus restrictions, where no working hours may be possible. Moreover, the opposition Labour Party has said that the new scheme incentivises employers in financial trouble to dismiss staff by making it more expensive to keep two people on reduced hours than to dismiss one and keep the other.","As the scheme is yet to be implemented, the numbers of companies which will take up the subsidy, as well as the numbers of employees who will be covered, is unknown.Independent economists put the cost of the chancellor’s Winter Plan in total at around GBP 5 billion, on top of the GBP 160 million already spent by the government. The Chancellor declined to put an exact price tag on the package, beyond saying that VAT measures will cost around GBP 800 million and job support about GBP 300 million a month for every 1 million workers enrolled.",National government,Employees in standard employment,Companies; National funds,"It has been widely reported that the new short-time working scheme has the broad support of the trade unions and the business lobby groups, and moreover, the scheme seems to have been designed with their input, as was the original furlough scheme (The Independent, 2020).  Indeed, the CBI's Director, Carolyn Fairbairn, had called for a successor to its furlough scheme to protect jobs, amid warnings that a large number of redundancies were expected as companies prepare for wage support to end in October (The Financial Times, 2020). On the scheme's launch, the CBI stated that it would, in conjunction with the other measures outlined, “save hundreds of thousands of viable jobs this winter."". The Chambers of Commerce director general, Adam Marshall, said that the package would give the economy “an important shot in the arm”, but warned that the chancellor “must remain open to taking additional action to support parts of the economy facing unprecedented challenges over the months ahead”. Manufacturers’ organisation Make UK said that the measures would “help avoid the significant redundancies we were facing had there been a cliff-edge end to government support”.The TUC confirmed that trade unions have been pushing hard for several months for jobs support to continue beyond October. It described the scheme as an 'important step' and said that it will provide a lifeline for many firms with a viable future beyond the pandemic. However, it has also argued that much more support is essential if large-scale job losses are to be avoided. The TUC calls on the government to urgently work with unions and business - in a National Recovery Council - on a wider support package for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy. It states that the industries such as aviation, retail, arts and hospitality needed targeted support now.",,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-outlines-winter-economy-plan; https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/new-job-scheme-important-ministers-will-need-do-far-more; https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jobs-support-scheme-rishi-sunak-furlough-announcement-speech-coronavirus-b572704.html; https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-and-loan-schemes

It was replaced on the 31 August by a new tripartite agreement on work sharing, which on one hand is less cost-intensive for the state than wage compensation, but on the other it is a helping hand to the unemployed and the companies since the periods not at work will be supported by a higher remuneration than the existing.**Legal reference**:* LOV nr 1336 af 11/09/2020.* Lov om adgang til iværksættelse af midlertidig arbejdsfordeling som led i håndteringen af COVID-19.* Act no 1336 of 11 September 2020.* Act on access to effectuate temporary work sharing as part of handling COVID-19.Due to a significant increase in the number of persons contaminated with coronavirus at the end of November 2020, the social partners and the government agreed to prolong the tripartite agreement on work sharing until the end of 2021.","The purpose of the new tripartite agreement of 31 August on work sharing is to mitigate a possible wave of redundancies on the private labour market, which is still affected by the corona crisis, after phasing out the wage compensation measure. The agreement implies that employees in the companies that chose to make use of the measure will work between 50% and 80% of the time. The rest of the working time, they are furloughed. They will receive full pay when at work and receive unemployment benefit for the time at home.The normal unemployment benefit rate is increased 20%, that is, to maximum DKK 23,000 (€3,087). In addition, non-insured, i.e. employees not member of an unemployment benefit fund will receive the same benefit rate. An employers’ contribution will primarily finance the increased unemployment benefit rate. According to the original work-sharing scheme, the time not at work is deducted in the allowed number of unemployment hours while still receiving a benefit rate. In the new temporary work-sharing agreement, this mechanism is set on hold, so that time not at work does not count as unemployment time.Companies that are already using the existing work-sharing agreement that in an easier accessible form was agreed in March 2020 as a support measure against the effects of the corona crisis can choose to change to this work-sharing scheme containing an enhanced benefit rate. Applications are still sent to the local job centre but is merely a formality. The new work-sharing scheme is so far valid for the rest of this year.  It will be evaluated and re-negotiated in the end of November.","The parties to the agreement, the government and the Danish Trade Union Confederation, FH, the Confederation of Professional Associations in Denmark, AC, and the Confederation of Danish Employers, DA, estimate that around 30,000 workplaces will have been encompassed by the work-sharing scheme during the first period in force, i.e. until the end of 2020.According to FH, 7,000 employees were in work sharing as of November 2020.The Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment (STAR) registered new cases of work sharing every month in 2020, which were:* Aug 2020: 1,537 persons * Sept 2020: 1,604 persons* Oct 2020: 908 persons* Nov 2020: 815 persons* Dec 2020: 219 personsThe Danish Ministry of Employment has a graph with the weekly number of total people (not just new as the previous numbers) using the temporary work sharing scheme.

It is framed by a wider package of active labour market policies, the programme ATIVAR.PT - Enhanced Support Programme to Employment and Vocational Training (ATIVAR.PT — Programa Reforçado de Apoios ao Emprego e à Formação Profissional). This Programme aims to ensure an adequate and rapid response with support programmes for hiring and internships, in articulation with programmes for specific sectors and groups.

The government now allocates a further €264 million to extend this first package of cultural measures to the first half of 2021. On top of this, the government allocates a further €150 million for local cultural infrastructure and another €68 million for municipalities and provinces.","The content of this measure is centred on funding different areas and aspects of the cultural, recreational, and related sectors.They key areas to be funded with the overall amount include:* Financing the programme costs of the national broadcast service: €19 million will go the NPO (the national broadcasting service in the Netherlands),* Support for zoos: due to lack of visitors the zoos have been badly hit and the revenue loss is expected to amount up to €132 million. To support zoos and the well-being of animals and workers there, the government assigns €39 million to zoos.*The events branch: new insurance instruments are being discussed which might allow events and related activities to start taking place again. The government indicates that if their role is useful in this endeavour, it will discuss and consider the form and scope of that role.*The travel branch: funds have been set-up to support smaller travel organisations and to protect consumers. These funds will provide extra financing and funding to the amount of €12.5 million.","Based on the preliminary results, published by OCW on 7 June, the overarching goals of the measures have been achieved: to keep cultural organizations afloat through support and succeed despite the loss of income. Institutions have reserved part of the support measures for expenditure in 2021 and can implement fewer measures as a result of the additional measures, resulting in lower costs.* Own income: own income has decreased from €330 in 2019 to €150 million in 2020. This is a decrease of approximately 55% compared to 2019. Own income is income from, for example, ticket sales, sponsorship and private contributions and (foreign) tournaments.* Additional support: the additional support represents 15% of the income in 2020 and compensates for 63% of the decrease in own income. If this support had not been earned, the institutions would have ended the year with a negative balance of approximately €56 million.* Expenses: total expenses decreased by 18%. Operating expenses fell by 27%. For museums, for example, there are 72% fewer purchases compared to a year earlier; a saving of €17 million. The management costs such as housing and office costs are approximately 10%.* Financial position: based on figures on liquidity, solvency and resilience, the picture is that, with a few exceptions, the institutions are financially sound.Long-term subsidised institutions by the national culture funds.

NL-2020-40/1259,Measures to promote economic investment,Maatregelen gericht op investeringen,Netherlands,Applies nationwide,10/01/2020,,Open ended,Other initiatives or policies,Entirely new measure ,"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","Support for spending, stimulus packages",10/07/2020,"As part of the third emergency package, made public on 1 October 2020, a series of actions have been outlined by the government. This third emergency package is broader than the preceding emergency package in that it contains details on a National Social Package, on package of measures for the cultural sector, details on measures the government intends to extend, as well as measures to promote the economic climate in the Netherlands until June 2021. The rationale here is that the focus must shift to a longer term perspective regarding the structure of the Dutch economy and the sustainable employment of workers. One of the themes within this third emergency package is on Measures to Promote Investment and the aim of these measures is to accelerate the recovery of the Dutch economy.","To accelerate the recovery of the Dutch economy the government will undertake several actions.* Public investment projects which had been planned to take place in the next few years are being started earlier to mitigate the financial setbacks experienced across sectors. This means that around €2 billion of public investments relating to rail and waterways, measures related to safety, infrastructure, construction of houses, and sustainability efforts, and investment in public defence will be brought forward to 2020 and 2021. The government is also working to establish an investment fund in this context.* A second area of focus is to promote private investments, which have declined during these uncertain times. This uncertainty actively prevents much private investment and the government intends to present measures on how to tackle this particular challenge in the coming months.* A third theme within this package of measures is to promote the solvency of Dutch enterprises to create financial room for new investments. The peak level national employer organisation, the VNO-NCW has taken the initiative together with other investors to set up an investment fund to specifically target medium size and large enterprises and to help them recapitalise. The proposal for this fund requests that the contributions by private investors in the fund be matched by government funding. As it stands the government will act as a silent investor in this fund and has reserved €300 million for this fund.* Besides investing in  medium-sized and large enterprises, the government will also focus investment on start-ups and scale-ups. The government will set up national start-up and scale-up facilitates through European and national funding, as well as financing through private investors. The Dutch government allocates €150 million to these facilities. At the regional level, the government will also provide extra funding of around €150 million to help regional enterprises environments; this funding will be paid to Regional Development Organisations (ROMs) which will allocate and the funding.* The fourth main priority area in this package is to promote innovation and to stimulate R&D.To do so, the government allocates further funding to the WBSO measure (an existing measure to subsidies R&D activities within Dutch enterprises), specifically to support start-ups. Furthermore, in connection with the EU MFF 2021–2027, there is room for extra investment in Dutch regional development, research and innovation, sustainability and digitisation. To stimulate these areas the Dutch government reserves €255 million to invest in these areas.",These measures have not yet been implemented and as such there is no information available at this time on their use.,National government; Employers' organisations; Local / regional government,,European Funds; National funds,"The social partners are generally pleased and satisfied with the new emergency package and its contents.

In addition, self-employed receiving unemployment insurance cannot work for their company while receiving the insurance. In case they work for the company, they lose their status as unemployed which leads to losing the insurance.In order to support self-employed whose possibilities to continue business activities have become limited due to the COVID-19 crisis, temporary changes to the right of self-employed to unemployment insurance have been made. The legal basis for these changes is temporary amendments to Decree on Unemployment Insurance (1997:835) (Förordning om arbetslöshetsförsäkring).","As a result of the temporary amendments, self-employed who receive unemployment allowance may continue with some activities related to the business operations during 2020 as long as the activities support the resumption of the operations when the market situation improves (e.g. some contact with clients or updating the company’s website). This temporary amendment entered in force 13 April 2020.In addition, the so-called five-year rule has been temporarily removed. This means that self-employed who pause operations in 2020 in order to receive unemployment insurance may do so again within the next five years and still receive unemployment insurance.

Due to recession following COVID-19, employers are facing a decline in business, poorer liquidity and higher costs due to the necessary adjustments to safe work processes.

The extraordinary support article applies to employers of a private nature, including those in the social sector, who have been affected by the COVID-19 disease pandemic and who are, as a result, in a business crisis situation.","The extraordinary support applies to companies of the private sector and of the social sector, which are in a business crisis situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The diploma considers a business crisis (Article 3) when there is a break in invoicing equal to or greater than 40%, in the month immediately preceding the initial request for support or extension, compared with the same month of the previous year; or compared to the average of the two previous months. For those that started activity less than one year before, the break in invoicing compares to the average monthly between the beginning of the activity and the penultimate month before the initial request. The working time reduction lasts for one month, but may be extended monthly while the Decree Law is in force (article 4).Companies are allowed to reduce the working time depending of the level of business crisis and of the time of year (Article 5): * by 50% in August and September and by 40% in the last quarter 2020 - when the break in invoicing is equal to or greater than 40%; * and by 70% and 60% in the same periods of the year - when there is a break in invoicing equal to or greater than 60%.During the reduction of the normal period of working time, the worker has the right to the wage corresponding to the hours worked and to a compensation for the hours not worked (Article 6). This compensation can be up to three times the statutory minimum wage (RMMG), in the amount of: two thirds of normal gross wage, in the months of August and September 2020 and four-fifths in the last quarter of 2020. If the value of these provisions is lower than the RMMG value, the compensation is increased to ensure it. The compensation is calculated in proportion of gross remuneration including: basic remuneration; monthly premiums; regular monthly allowances, bonus for shift work and night work; and meal allowance. The estimation of the compensation has into account the compliance with the statutory minimum wage.The employer is entitled to financial support exclusively for the purpose of paying the compensation to workers. Social security supports 70% of the compensation, the employers are responsible for ensuring the remaining 30% (Article 7). The amount paid by Social Security is financed by the State Budget of the State. The support provided is subject to European funding the respective provisions of national law and the European Union being applicable to them (Article 17).The measures provided for in this decree-law are subject to regular assessment by the social partners Standing Committee for Social Concertation (Article 18).The PEES foresees that the budgetary amount covering this measure and prolongation of simplified layoff (when companies close by government determination) will be around €730 million (to be financed by the state budget + SURE).Decree Law 90/2020 amends the extraordinary support for the gradual resumption of activity in companies in a situation of business crisis with a reduction of the normal working period: If the employer has a fall in turnover of 40% or more, the working time reduction can be as much as 50%; if the employer has a fall in turnover of 60% or more, the working time reduction can be as much as 70%. In situations where the working time reduction is higher than 60%, the employee's wage compensation is adjusted to ensure that he/she receives 88% of his/her gross salary. Employers with a fall in turnover of 75% or more can now reduce the working time in 100%.

This amount must be prorated according to the employee's share of working time and the actual duration of his or her employment contract.The aid is not due for periods :* of absence of the employee, which have not resulted in the employer maintaining the remuneration;* during which the employee is placed in a partial activity under ordinary law or in a long-term partial activity (APLD).When an employee previously linked to the employer by a fixed-term contract that has given rise to entitlement to aid concludes a permanent or fixed-term contract of at least three months before 28 February 2021, the employer continues to receive aid up to a maximum amount of €4,000. The employer continues to receive aid even if the employee lost the status of disabled worker during the previous contract.**Procedure for applying for aid**To benefit from the aid, the employer must submit a request via an online platform to the ASP. The application must be made within a maximum period of six months following the start date of the contract. Applications may only be submitted from 4 January 2021. When applying for aid, employers must certify on their honour that they meet the conditions for eligibility for aid.The aid is then paid by the ASP on the basis of a certificate from the employer justifying the employee's presence and periods of absence that do not give entitlement to aid. The employer is required to send this certificate before the four months following the end of each quarter of the contract. Failure to submit one of these certificates will result in the definitive loss of aid for the quarter concerned.","According to Agefiph, 2.8 million people were recognised as disabled in 2018 (data published in June 2019), i.e. 7% of the population aged between 15 and 64.

Due to COVID-19, the new option of Uber delivering products purchased on Konzum's online store is now available in Zagreb and its surroundings, as well as in Split and Kastela, Rijeka and Kukuljanovo, Dubrovnik and Pula, and the plan is currently to expand the new Croatian delivery service to other cities throughout the country. From now on, customers buying products on Konzum's online store have the additional option of having their ordered groceries, household and hygiene supplies and other products to their selected address thanks to Konzum's partnership with Uber, which also brings its global DropOff service to Croatia. This new Croatian delivery service is currently available to customers from Zagreb, Sesvete, Samobor, Zapresic, Velika Gorica, Split and Kastela,  as well as in Rijeka and Kukuljanovo, Dubrovnik and Pula. The buying process has been made very simple. After selecting the desired products on Konzum's online store, the customer should the select the Partner Delivery service and then select their delivery location. ","When compared to the Konzum regular delivery option. Thus, it should be borne in mind that when choosing the Partner Delivery service, Uber drivers pick up the products in stores and therefore it isn't always possible to display the exact stock status on the page in real time. If a certain product is not on the store's shelf, Konzum employees will call the customer and check if they want a replacement item. The range available through the Partner Delivery service is narrower than the one available to customers who choose the Konzum delivery option, and the ordered products are delivered to the person's home address, but not to their very doorstep. Payment is made exclusively online, the minimum order amount is HRK 200  (€ 26.7), and delivery is charged at HRK 30 (€ 4) regardless of the size of the order. The big advantage of this new Croatian delivery service is the possibility of having your items delivered on the same day, considering that the delivery terms are available to the customer within four hours from the moment of ordering. If it suits the customer better, they can then schedule the delivery for another day, within a week from the day of ordering. After the customer completes the purchase on Konzum's online store, Konzum schedules their delivery via the Uber Central platform. Confirmation of the scheduled delivery to the customer will arrive via SMS in which they will receive information about the vehicle registration number and the name of the Uber driver, who will contact the customer by phone when they arrive at the corresponding address so that they can pick up the ordered products. ","It could be expecting a significant interest for this type of delivery. Konzum is constantly recording an increase in interest in online shopping, and we're striving to provide our customers with an even more pleasant online shopping experience through numerous innovations and investments. In the spring, with the launch of the additional Pokupi (Pickup) service, Konzum enabled customers the ability to purchase groceries and other products from the comfort of their own homes even in the most challenging times, and in partnership with Uber Konzum wants to offer them a new option so that they can receive their orders at their home address on the same day. Uber is continuing to work to support the community of its users and drivers during these difficult times. The company is pleased to have opened its platform in cooperation with Konzum, which will speed up food delivery for Croats and help drivers overcome this challenging situation. User and driver safety issue remains a priority for Uber. The company distributed 950 hygiene kits to drivers containing masks, gloves, disinfectant gels and sprays. In addition, Uber has focused its efforts on implementing real-time processes and technology solutions to ensure responsible and safe use of the services at all times.

Similar to the metalworkers a few weeks earlier, the conclusion was reached already in the first negotiating round, foreseeing a basic wage increase of 1.5% (compensating for inflation).In addition, all companies ""which can afford it"" are called upon to pay a bonus of at least €150 to their employees. According to the union, every fourth retail worker will benefit from this measure. For apprentices, which were by regulation exempt from home-schooling during the lockdown in order to work, this bonus is mandatory. The bonus is to be paid by 1 December 2020.","Several supermarket chains (Rewe, Lidl, Hofer, Spar) have announced that they would pay such a bonus to their employees, also higher than the minimum amount of €150.

NL-2020-25/1366,Employers organisations' guidelines on working conditions during COVID-19 crisis,Werkgeversorganisaties Nota: Arbeidsvoorwaarden in Coronacrisis,Netherlands,Applies nationwide,06/17/2020,,Open ended,Non-binding recommendations or other texts,Not applicable,Supporting businesses to stay afloat,Other,10/30/2020,"The Netherlands has recently (3 October 2020) introduced a third national emergency package of measures to help enterprises, entrepreneurs, and specific sectors to weather the economic and social crisis the pandemic has caused. However, the crisis also threatens to permanently change some sectors and certain ways of working. As such, with a view to the future, there is increasing emphasis within the measures on the need to school and re-train workers to move into different professions or into different sectors all together because some sectors are likely to shrink permanently.In reaction to the economic and social hardship from the COVID-19 crisis, the national, peak level employer organisations, (the VNO-NCW, MKB Nederland, and AWVN), developed a note on Working Conditions during the COVID-19 crisis. This note was developed in reaction to the fact that many enterprises will likely face hardship until well into 2021. Due to the crisis, most collective labour negotiations have come to a standstill since March 2020. Employers and trade unions agree that in many cases there is too much economic uncertainty to make plans regarding working conditions and pay for the next one to two years (the typical length of Dutch collective labour agreements). The employer organisations therefore developed this note to provide guidance to employer organisations on how to consider and address collective labour agreements and working conditions during the crisis. ","The Working Conditions during the COVID-19 crisis is a soft tool in the sense that it has been designed as a guideline for employers on how to consider the agreements regarding working conditions made in collective labour agreements. The emphasis within the note is to save costs where it is necessary and to invest where it is possible. Investing in workers and their skilling is prominently mentioned as an area for all employers to consider very seriously and to start taking steps on.A key feature in the note is on how to deal with sectoral and single employer collective labour agreements. It also offers ideas and advice to employers on which actions they can take in the short and longer term to lower costs but still invest in their enterprises and notably, their workers, where they can.A specific area within the note refers to the fact that agreed upon sectoral wage increases may not be possible in many sectors because employers simply do not have the financial capacity to do so and that employers should reflect very carefully on what is possible for the coming one to two years. The document offers ideas on what an employer can offer employees which meet the economic and social challenges to come.* Some collective labour agreements are likely to need revisiting as sectorally agreed wage increases cannot take place. For instance, in the event that a sectoral wage increase is not possible, enterprises can consider other agreements such as more vacation days, extra personal development budgets, a one-time extra payment of a given amount.* Some sectoral agreements concerning wage may however be postponed instead of cancelled completely. The postponement can be made conditional based on the revenue ultimately generated by an employer, the sectoral development, or national economic development. * Some sectors may of course be in a position to implement wage increases despite the crisis. If this is possible at the sectoral level this is obviously positive, but does not mean that individual employers can all offer the wage increase as easily. In this case extra, enterprise specific agreements can be made.The note also cautions and indicates that in many cases, revisiting wage agreements will be difficult and should only be considered as a last resort.","This is a soft measure and not one with concrete, measurable outcomes. Furthermore, it is not clear to what degree employers have taken note of these guidelines at this stage due to the very limited amount of collective labour agreements made since March 2020.",Employers' organisations,,No special funding required,"The views and reactions to the note are divided along relatively predictable fault lines. The employer organisations have tried to offer practical insights and steps for  employers which consider both the economic difficulties of enterprises and aim to help enterprises protect themselves and remain viable; not only for the enterprise but at a macro level, for the economy as a whole. The note strives to emphasise the importance of the worker however and their well-being, and to offer them security or prospects where possible. On the other hand, understandably, trade unions such as the CNV and FNV, are not pleased with what they feel can turn into a carte blanche for re-opening collective labour agreements and their provisions on agreed upon wage increases. The unions argue that protecting the workers in this time of uncertainty is key and maintaining a good salary is important not only for the individual, but from a macro sense, for the purchasing power and consumption levels in the overall economy",,,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.awvn.nl/download/31525/?page=31532

The measure was, however, set as only temporary for 180 days (then, in September extended for the entire period of the state of pandemics + 3 months after its end).As remote work has been generally well - considering the circumstances - received by both employees and employers, the idea of making the temporary solution permanent emerged. With arrival of the second wave of the pandemic, the issue became even more urgent. As a result the government stepped in with a proposal to integrate the remote work and relevant regulations to the Labour Code. Initially, the idea was to replace the chapter on telework with a new set of provisions on remote work. This idea was presented to the social partners in August. In the meantime, however, due to internal reorganisation of the government (Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy dismantled and their prerogatives divided between Ministry of Development and Ministry of Family and Social Policy), the process was put on hold. It is now (early November) unclear whether the original concept will be further proceeded or replaced by a new one).","Remote work is now defined in very vague terms. The law stipulates only that an ""employer may request that the employee performs, for a definite period, work away from its permanent site (remote work), as long as the state of pandemic emergency or state of pandemics is in force for an additional three months after it ends"". The issues of workplace safety, compensation for usage of own equipment (such as laptop computers and other devices), electric power or other supplies necessary or helpful in performing work acquired by the employee are at his or her own expense and are not regulated whatsoever.","According to national statistics (GUS), as of October some 25% of the workforce have been engaged in remote work.",National government; Social partners jointly,,No special funding required,"Supportive to the basic idea of making the provisional solution into permanent.

The company decided to start such production when the general public and especially the medical staff faced with a dramatic shortage of disinfectant liquids in the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a transformation during the quarantine period allowed the company to enter a new product group with almost no costs for advertising.","As soon as the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the world and many countries started facing shortages of disinfection products, the company decided not to wait for the virus to spread in Lithuania and start producing disinfectant liquids. This option was considered because the company had all the technical capabilities to produce such liquids, i.e. production lines adapted to dispense large quantities of chemical liquids, own laboratory and chemists able to ensure the quality of the new product. Moreover, the main raw material, ethyl alcohol, has already been used in the company’s products for vehicles.The company took the risk of ordering large quantities of basic raw materials, containers and caps even prior to being issued a permit from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Lithuania (MH) to produce disinfectant liquids. Yet, the risk paid off, and the company was one of the first to start producing disinfectants as soon as permission was obtained from the MH. Moreover, the company managed to save money, because the price of neutral spirits soon grew significantly and there was a shortage of containers and caps on the market, but the company had them in place because it had purchased the materials in advance.In order to urgently meet the need for disinfectants in Lithuania, the plant worked two shifts on weekdays and weekends.The liquid was first supplied to state institutions (hospitals, clinics) and then to retail chains, pharmacies and gas stations.","As the product was highly demanded, the company entered a new product group with almost no advertising costs.

It provides for three main measures: no recourse to short-time working, maintenance of gross pay for all active employees, and changes to the rules on taking paid leave or leave linked to reduced working hours.In particular, the bank plans to require employees to take ten days off work, including five working days of paid leave, before 31 May, on dates set by the bank. The agreement, which implements the measures provided for by Ordinance 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, is rather balanced as it supplements the temporary measures allowed by the ordinance with a number of guarantees for employees.","** Arrangements for taking paid leaves** Pursuant to Order 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, the agreement allows the employer to impose the taking - or modification of the dates of taking - of 5 days of paid leave. The notice period is 3 days (whereas the ordinance allows this period to be reduced to 1 day). The agreement reduces the number of days that can be imposed for employees whose leaves entitlements are not complete, on a pro rata basis. The agreement gives a priority for taking of leave during the period from 7 April to 9 May 2020, which undoubtedly corresponds to a desire to use up the leave before a full resumption of activity envisaged later in the year. The days of paid leave already validated are deducted from the total number of days that may be imposed.** Adjustment of working time reduction days**In addition, the agreement allows the employer to impose or modify the dates for taking 5 working days of reduced working time (RTT) – whereas the ordinance allows the employer to impose or postpone up to 10 days of RTT –] again with a notice period of 3 days. This rule applies only to employees with 20 or more days of reduced working time for the year 2020. For other employees, this rule applies on a pro rata basis.Finally, for employees on a specific work stoppage during the COVID-19 pandemic (for childcare, for example), the taking of leave and RTT days is imposed after this stoppage, unless it lasts 30 days at most, in which case the employee is exempt.","The agreement applies to about 17,500 employees of the LCL bank in France.",Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment; Workers in non-standard forms of employment,Companies; Employer,The agreement receives the support of the social partners that have signed it.,,,Yes,Only private sector,"K64 Financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding",No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041755940

The social partners wished to organise the 'gradual and adapted' resumption of work within a negotiated framework. The agreement on the resumption of activity is applicable until the end of 2020. Over this period, its provisions will replace existing practices and agreements in the areas covered by the agreement. It defines the work organisation and telework. The return to the workplace is gradual and secure, using team rotation and relay and temporary mobility.","The agreement covers the organisation of working time. Indeed, the agreement aims to enable MATMUT companies with fewer than 50 employees, who are more vulnerable due to the health crisis, to access working time organisation measures. The group undertakes not to have recourse to State aid and to maintain the remuneration of employees unable to telework. The agreement provides for rotations between teams, between teleworking and on-site presence, and the introduction of staggered working hours with the introduction of shift work by successive or overlapping teams. However, the employees' initial working hours are maintained. In addition, to support teams in difficulty, employees who volunteer to do so may be able to temporarily take part in a functional or geographical mobility scheme. The agreement was therefore put in place to deal with the crisis and is fairly well balanced in terms of the provisions on working time arrangements.","The agreement applies to about 6,200 employees in France.",Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment; Workers in non-standard forms of employment,Companies; Employer,Social partners have signed the agreement and therefore support the adopted measures.,,,Yes,Only private sector,"K65 Insurance, reinsurance and pension funding, except compulsory social security",No,,,

They present, for example, the procedure to be followed by the employer in the event of an outbreak of contamination in the company or the actions that an employee can take if the prevention measures taken by the employer are inadequate.","On 6 and 9 October 2020, the Ministry of Labour and the Health Insurance published two handbooks 'COVID-19: advice and good practices', one for employers and the other for employees.**What should the employer do in the event of a cluster in the company?**In the event of an outbreak of contamination (""cluster"") in the company, i.e. when three employees have been diagnosed positive for COVID-19 over seven days, the employer must alert the ARS (regional health agency) and the labour inspectorate and follow their instructions. He must inform the works council (CSE) of the cluster and the measures envisaged as a matter of urgency, involving it in the discussion on their implementation and 'while respecting the anonymity of the persons concerned'. It can also 'ensure that contact cases have been contacted by the Health Insurance so that they remain isolated, consult a doctor and get tested' and 'reinforce telework when possible'. On the other hand, the employer may not establish a 'file of infected persons and contact cases', disseminate the names of these persons, require employees to inform him/her of the result of the screening test and keep this result, or oblige an infected employee to come to work. **What can an employee do if prevention is insufficient?**Employees are invited to alert staff representatives, the occupational health service or the labour inspectorate if they consider that the measures taken to prevent the risk of contamination are insufficient.The guide recalls that they can exercise their ""right of withdrawal"" if they consider that there is a serious and imminent danger, by alerting their employer to the situation, provided that the withdrawal does not endanger others. However, if the employer has implemented the recommendations of the Ministries of Labour and Health to protect its employees from the risk of contamination, the handbook states that an employee cannot, 'in principle', legitimately exercise his or her right of withdrawal. However, in the event of a withdrawal that is considered abusive, the employer may withhold wages. Furthermore, it is recalled that an employee cannot telework if his employer has not given his consent. Neither can he refuse to wear a mask (provided by the employer) where this is compulsory and, failing this, he may be sanctioned if this is provided for in a memorandum or in the company's internal rules.

They must also have an income tax or USC liability against which the tax credit can be set. Qualifying people who don’t have a smart phone will also be able to make claim online or by post.","The Revenue estimates that up to 2.7 million taxpayers could qualify for the Stay and Spendtax credit.

According to the paper, figures show that up to January 18, 4,441 claims for tax relief under the scheme were included in 2020 income tax returns, relating to €1.5m of qualifying expenditure that was submitted on Revenue's receipts tracker app. This entitles those who used the scheme to total tax relief of €305,430.

Whenever remote work is not possible, the staggered work schedule is to be implemented, in order to limit congestion in public transportation. According to art. 21 of Law no. 55/2020 on some measures to prevent and combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the state of alert, employers with more than 50 employees organise the work schedule so that the staff is divided into groups that start, respectively end the activity with a gap of at least one hour. On large industrial platforms or in office buildings, the start of the professional activity at the same time is to be avoided.","While the delayed program was previously only a possibility, starting from November 2020 it is an obligation of the employer, who will have to ensure access of employees to the workplace at different times. The legislation provides for this obligation as an alternative to the employer's obligation to order remote working, whenever this is objectively possible. The employer has the obligation to send employees on telework, and the employees have the obligation to comply with this decision of the employer. No agreement of the parties is required, but a simple unilateral decision of the employer. Non-compliance with these duties is sanctioned with a fine between RON 1,000 and 5,000.The measure of delaying the work schedule is applied in companies which, by the nature of the activity, cannot use remote work.The Labour Inspectorate has launched the National Campaign to verify the application of the legal provisions on work at home, telework, staggered work schedules, safety and health at work, in order to reduce the risk of contamination with COVID-19. The campaign took place between 10 and 24 November 2020, targeting employers with more than 50 employees.","Most companies with more than 50 employees have implemented this measure. For example, in the Clujana shoe factory, the work schedule has been modified to correspond to the new provisions. Most factory employees commute outside the city by minibus. They will start working at 6, 7 and 8 o'clock, respectively. The staggered program is implemented all the more as the work cannot be performed in telework.At Ford Craiova plant the 3,600 employees work in three shifts, with long breaks between them.In Timiș County, a number of 622 employers – with over 50 employees – have already introduced staggered work schedules in application of these provisions. 250,000 employees work in Timiș County, of which about 10% currently use remote work or have a staggered work schedule",National government; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment; Larger corporations; Other businesses,No special funding required,"The Labor Pact is an alliance of the most important employers' organisations.

","A few English Language Schools, such as BELS, were proactive and brought forwards plans to offer online English courses during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to this, all teaching was classroom-based. This resulted in an array of English language courses being offered for learners of different levels and interests (e.g., English for business). Such online courses remain ongoing. Once Schools re-opened physically on 1 July 2020, a Federation of English Language Teaching Organisation Malta (FELTOM) survey highlighted that arrivals in the first week, were just 9% of the numbers seen in 2019. Numbers were expected to peak at 12.8% in August. Schools introduced a range health and safety initiatives to protect staff and clients. EF, an English language school, ensures that staff and students wear face masks at all times, practice frequent good health hygiene, and observe social distancing. Incoming students are asked to present a certificate not older than 72 hours old warranting that they are COVID-19 negative, and if this is not brought, are asked to enter preventative quarantine and carry out the test privately. Staff and students who have tested positive for COVID-19 have been quarantined. Other measures include the availability of sanitisers, temperature and name checks, informational leaflets and posters, and frequent cleaning. ","in 2019, 83,610 foreign students attended English Language courses at local licensed schools. In 2019, July was the busiest month, with 18,457 arrivals. Arrivals in July 2020 slumped to around 9% of these numbers. ",Employers' organisations; Company / Companies,Particular professions; Youth (18-25); Sector specific set of companies; Other groups of citizens,Companies,FELTOM reacted positively to the COVID-19 Wage Supplement but highlighted that the sector requires further support. An October Deloitte report commissioned by FELTOM recommended that the wage supplement be sustained at a decreasing scale until business volume returns to 70% of what it had been before the COVID-19 pandemic. Progressive support was also recommended for organisations with more than 40% loss in arrivals.,,,Yes,Only private sector,P85 Education,Yes,Teaching professionals,,https://newsbook.com.mt/en/language-school-insists-that-students-teachers-are-under-mandatory-quarantine/; https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/business/business_news/105367/englishlanguage_industry_needs_up_to_79_million_in_government_covid19_support#.X7KTieWSk2x

The latter should preserve 1,502 jobs. As for the first agreement, it organises voluntary mobility, both internal and external, and provides for redeployment aid for employees whose redundancy could not be avoided. The voluntary departure phase, which will end at the end of March 2021, should avoid redundancies.","Hit hard by the economic crisis linked to COVID-19, the aircraft manufacturer Airbus has announced a project to cut 4,248 jobs in France. On 12 October 2020, to avoid forced dismissals, Airbus concluded two agreements with the three trade unions CFE-CGC, CFTC and FO, one on the group's draft adaptation plan implementing a job protection plan (social plan) and the second implementing the long-term short-time working scheme (APLD). **Voluntary departure plan**In order to limit redundancies, a voluntary phase was implemented from 15 July. Eligibility for voluntary departures notably includes a substitution mechanism for employees who are not affected by the job protection plan, but whose voluntary departure would allow the internal redeployment of an affected employee by freeing up their position. The specific structure set up to support employee volunteers is called Mobility Pathways. Run by consultants from within and outside the group, it helps and prepares employees to formalise and implement their project. **Support measures**The agreement provides for various measures (aid, indemnities, etc.) for the benefit of volunteer employees depending on the scheme chosen (mobility, retirement, etc.). For instance, those who opt for external mobility receive a voluntary severance payment equal to at least five months' gross reference salary. Anyone who volunteers during the early redeployment phase and leaves the company before 31 December 2020 will also receive a two-month 'rapidity' bonus. An employee whose basic salary in a new position is lower than their Airbus basic salary will receive a differential allowance. This is capped at €350 gross per month for 12 months for a full-time working day. In the context of the creation, takeover or development of an already created company, the entrepreneur can claim a bonus of €6,000 gross for each recruitment of an Airbus employee. **Age measures**There is also a 'voluntary measure for a generational age-related measure' which provides for Airbus to pay up to €10,000 to participate in the purchase of quarters of contributions to the statutory pension scheme (which allows people to retire earlier) or the effect on the amount of the pension of a reduction in the pension (décote) linked to retiring before being able to benefit from a full pension. **Support for reclassification**The agreement includes redeployment assistance measures for employees whose dismissal could not be avoided. After setting out the criteria for establishing the order of redundancies, the agreement details the internal redeployment process. Reemployment offers will be made as soon as possible after the end of the voluntary period. The internal reclassification phase will last for a period of one month. **Reclassification leave**In the absence of internal reclassification, the employee will be offered reclassification leave in his or her letter of notice of dismissal. This leave is nine months, including notice, and is extended to 12 months for employees with characteristics that make it more difficult for them to return to work (e.g. disabled employees, heads of single-parent families, employees over 55 years of age). During the reclassification period corresponding to the notice period, the employee will receive the remuneration normally due. For the period exceeding the notice period, the employee will receive an allowance equal to 80% of the average gross monthly pay received during the last 12 months, excluding amounts corresponding to profit-sharing or incentive payments. **Follow-up committee**According to the agreement, a joint monitoring committee is set up. This committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with the principles of solidarity between Airbus divisions, promoting mobility between sites and divisions and guaranteeing overall consistency, particularly vis-à-vis the public authorities. It also arbitrates specific cases and any disputes. **Recourse to long-term short-time working**The reduction in activity under the specific log-term short-time working scheme (APLD), provided for in the second agreement, will be implemented as of 1 January 2021, for a maximum of 24 months (until 31 December 2022). The personnel concerned by the scheme are production staff working on the various programmes. The agreement, production operations and support functions within the production group (production management, logistical support, etc.) are specifically targeted. The system must enable 1,502 jobs to be preserved. The reduction in activity (at most 40% of legal working hours) should be, over the period of application of the system, around 15% on average for the activities concerned. The implementation of the APLD for two years entails an adjustment of work organisation in the company detailed in the agreement. **Solidarity funds** Finally, the creation of a solidarity fund to cushion the financial impact of the reduction in working time is planned. The detailed terms and conditions of this fund will be subject to the contractualisation of economic measures that will make it possible to finance this fund by mid-December at the latest. ","The agreement applies to the 29,334 Airbus employees in France.

This text also introduces a procedure for recognition 'outside the tables', in particular for so-called 'second-line' workers. These employees, as well as those who have suffered from ‘less severe’ conditions related to the COVID-19, will be required to demonstrate the link between their infection and their activities. ","A decree of 14 September creates two new occupational disease tables, dedicated to 'acute respiratory ailments linked to a Sars CoV2 infection', one for the general scheme which applies to all employees in the private sector, the other for the agricultural scheme which applies only to staff in the agricultural sector. **Care workers** These tables cover all care staff, persons providing transport for the sick, administrative staff in the care sector, and staff in social and medico-social establishments. However, although the government had announced that liberal health care staff would benefit from easier recognition, they are not covered by the tables. **Other salaried employees**Infected workers who do not fall within the scope of these tables, for their part, benefit from a facilitated recognition procedure, conducted before a regional committee for the recognition of occupational diseases, dedicated to COVID-19.**Severity of illness criterion**The two tables limit coverage for occupational diseases to a condition of seriousness, care and precise documentation. Thus, only acute respiratory ailments related to Sars CoV2 are considered as potential occupational diseases. The condition must be confirmed by biological examination, CT scan or a documented clinical history (hospitalisation report, medical documents) and have required oxygen therapy attested by medical reports or have led to death.**Professional missions**The victim of an acute respiratory illness due to COVID-19, in order to have an occupational disease recognised in the context of one of these tables, must justify the accomplishment of work in the presence of the patient, according to a restrictive list. The table of the general scheme thus recognises work carried out by care and similar staff, laboratory staff, service and maintenance staff or by administrative staff, whether it was carried out in hospital at home or in private or public care establishments, and social and medico-social establishments.Also covered are prevention, transport and patient accompaniment staff who have carried out COVID-19 transport and patient accompaniment activities in vehicles assigned for this purpose.**Recognition 'outside the table'**When the conditions resulting from these tables are not met, recognition of the after-effects of COVID-19 contamination remains possible, and applications must be presented, as provided for in the decree, before a single regional occupational disease recognition committee dedicated to COVID-19. Its composition is lightened to allow a faster examination of the files. It thus comprises :* a medical adviser from the medical control department of the Assurance Maladie or the central fund of the Mutualité sociale agricole, or a retired medical adviser;* a university lecturer in hospital practice or a hospital practitioner particularly qualified in occupational pathology, resuscitation or infectiology, either active or retired, or an occupational physician, either active or retired. The practitioner will be appointed for four years and included on a list drawn up by order of the Director General of the Regional Health Agency.",No data available.,National government; Social insurance,Employees in standard employment; Workers in non-standard forms of employment; Workers in care facilities,National funds,"The decree is considered as too restrictive according to trade unions. For instance, the CFDT criticised the Decree No. 2020-1131 of 14 September 2020, which should facilitate the recognition of a condition linked to Covid-19 as an occupational disease, in a press release of 17 November. This response 'is very insufficient' according to the union. 'It restricts recognition to carers who have been treated under oxygen therapy or ventilatory assistance', the CFDT points out. But 'at the present time, we regularly discover new penalizing after-effects, including asymptomatic or little symptomatic forms that did not require oxygen therapy'. Thus, 'it would be much more relevant to establish a recognition linked to the exposure and accompanied by a dedicated fund, following the example of the treatment of asbestos exposure, as proposed by the CFDT'. The union therefore 'joins the health and social federation and all the CFDT's professional federations that have joined in challenging Decree No. 2020-1 131 before the Conseil d'Etat (the highest Administrative jurisdiction) and urges the government to review this measure'.",,,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/file/DMtj4batQCevQUtg5Nb8H6pX1UJ1rDeZ-KtqKaYgx6E=/JOE_TEXTE; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/pdf?id=8K4TLaMUFL1vIW71woXd37wrz_FxX4n3ui1wgdsrojQ=

This agreement generalises and perpetuates telework beyond the COVID-19 crisis, in order to strengthen the quality of working life and promote flexibility.The use of teleworking is offered to all Suez employees in France whose activity allows it. Based on the principle of voluntary work, the agreement provides for teleworking at an average rate of two days per week over the calendar year. In an internal survey launched last May, employees welcomed teleworking and expressed their desire to make it sustainable. Since then, management and the social partners have been reflecting on new ways of working and have affirmed their desire to promote flexibility and agility for everyone while ensuring a better balance between their professional life and their personal and family life for all employees.","The main provision of the agreement are the folowing:**An agreement for all employees eligible to telework**All employees of the SUEZ Group companies in France, whatever their employment contract, whatever their seniority are eligible to telework. However, the position held must be compatible with this work organisation. The employee must have individual organisational skills and a proven degree of autonomy in his or her job.**Home office**The employee's home must be suitable for remote work: adapted workspace, ergonomics and tranquillity, and also equipped with a secure high-speed internet connection. The employee must meet the requirements for multi-risk home insurance. All employees wishing to benefit from teleworking must submit a formal request to their manager with a diagnostic form that objectifies their eligibility for teleworking (compatible workstation, independence, home that allows teleworking, certificate of comprehensive home insurance that covers home working).**A rhythm that adapts to everyone**Teleworking will be carried out on a full day basis at the rate of 2 days per week on average over the calendar year (with some exceptions). The days are not necessarily fixed in the week.On the other hand, in order to ensure the maintenance of a collective face-to-face time that contributes to the social link and the preservation of the working collective, a provisional planning of teleworking days will be shared with the manager. In the event of operational necessity or on-call duty, the employee will have to go to the company's premises.**A voluntary working method**Teleworking is not compulsory. For employees who wish to do so, a period of adaptation to telework is foreseen during the first 3 months of the year. It can be stopped at any time, at the request of the employee or the manager (with the agreement of the N+2).**Equipment and costs**An employee who works partly at home benefits from the following advantages:* a lump-sum and global allowance paid by the company in the amount of €20 per month, exempt from social security and tax charges, for the employee who actually teleworks an average of 2 days per week over the year.* a meal voucher for the days on which he or she is teleworking, up to a maximum limit of 2 days per week on average over the year and under conditions that comply with the regulations in force.The employee will have a laptop computer made available by the company for the performance of his or her teleworking duties, as well as, if necessary, secure remote VPN access.The company will also offer a telephony solution to teleworking employees that guarantees respect for privacy: for example, connection of a telephone terminal to the computer, Skype Enterprise or mobile phone if the employee's position is eligible.Employees who wish to do so will be able to access special rates, negotiated by the Group's Purchasing Department, for the purchase of certain computer peripherals or office furniture.","The agreement applies to about 35,000 employees in France.",Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment; Workers in non-standard forms of employment,Companies; Employer,"The agreement is supported by the signatory unions. For the CFDT, 'the agreement guarantees the maintenance of purchasing power, while at the same time making it possible to protect employees from social isolation by distributing working time at their own initiative'. For the CFE-CGC, 'this collective approach gives managers and their employees the room for manoeuvre they need to cope with the constraints of working life and to carry out their daily work in the best possible conditions'.

The employer must always set the rules 'within the framework of local social dialogue, ensuring the maintenance of links within the work group and the prevention of risks related to the isolation of employees working from home'. The employer must also regularly remind employees of the need for systematic compliance with the rules of hygiene and distancing and inform them 'of the existence of the ""TousAntiCovid"" application (which replaces the StopCovid application) and the value of its activation during working hours'.**Masks: no more exemptions in enclosed collective places**The possibility of temporarily removing one's mask in enclosed and shared workplaces, subject to compliance with other health measures, in certain areas, is removed from the protocol. Thus, the wearing of masks must be systematic for people in enclosed and shared workplaces.**Authorisation for screening in companies using rapid tests**'In addition to the screening campaigns organised by the health authorities and in which companies can participate, employers can, in compliance with the regulatory conditions, propose screening actions to those of their employees who are volunteers', the protocol now states. Until now, any screening action organised by the company was prohibited.This new possibility only concerns 'rapid tests authorised' by the health authorities, in compliance with the prescribed conditions of use. The employer must finance all of these screening actions, which must be 'carried out under conditions that guarantee the proper performance of these tests and the strict preservation of medical confidentiality'. Thus, the results of the tests may not be communicated to the employer or its employees.On the other hand, an employer still cannot organise a serological testing campaign.",It applies to all private law employers and employees.,National government,,No special funding required,No information available.,,,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/protocole-national-sante-securite-en-entreprise.pdf; https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/protocole-national-sante-securite-en-entreprise.pdf

At the webinar, the Chamber of Commerce’s regional office Postojna presented the company as a good practice in mitigating the negative consequences of COVID-19. The president of the board of directors Mr. Janez Remec spoke of how they managed to halt the spread of infection and assure the continuation of production in a situation when a third of their employees test positive for COVID-19.","In February 2020, _Pivka perutninarstvo_ has already established a crisis unit for monitoring the situation. Safety measures adopted at that time were the routes of movement, lunch break in turn, replacement staff, reserve locations, testing of contractual partners, ban of informal gatherings (distance markers on the floor), supervisors surveilling the compliance with safety measures. First employees were tested positive for COVID-19 in March 2020, but the prompt responses easily halted the spread of the epidemics. From this experience, the company learned the necessary precaution in a slaughterhouse where the spread of the virus is 12 times faster than in other environments. The company experienced another breakout of the epidemic in September 2020. This time the number of employees who tested positive for COVID-19 reached as many as 74 employees. The prompt responses of management together with the collaboration of the mayor and the Civil Protection helped in curbing the spread of infection. Contrary to the official instructions, the Civil Protection organised immediate testing of all employees. Only workers tested negative for COVID-19 were allowed to work. Twelfth workers who missed testing were banned from entering the company and got a 10-day vacation.According to the representative of the Civil Protection, the communication of breakout to the public was decisive for enabling immediate joint action. It is a model for some companies which give infected workers ten days off telling them that they must not inform the public about infection in the company.","After the testing, the company coped with the problem of how to continue to work with only two-thirds of workers. A big moral support came from competitive firms which offered their help and undertook some work for them. Sick workers were replaced by the management and administration workers who were assigned jobs in the production process. As a result, the production output was almost the same as in the pre-crisis period, and no workers got infected later on.

Doctors moved to other departments and nurses from 'regular' departments to intensive care. Support personnel was also utilised to man the triage centres in front of the hospitals that were used for large scale testing. Administrative personnel was however also to a large extent obliged to continue working on site (in contrast to the general lockdown rules that apply to the majority of white collar workers). This to try to keep necessary operations going as fluently as possible.Another example was the fact that the hospital psychologists were retrained to assist the care personnel instead of their regular clients (that were no longer allowed to enter the hospital). In additional specific stress coaches were appointed in order to deal with stress related issues among staff.

SI-2020-45/1482,"Survey of companies about workers, infected in workplaces",Anketa podjetij o obolelih na delovnem mestu,Slovenia,Applies nationwide,11/06/2020,11/09/2020,Open ended,Other initiatives or policies,Not applicable,"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace",Occupational health and safety,11/27/2020,"On 16 October 2020, the Slovenian government issued _Ordinance on the declaration of the COVID-19 epidemic in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia_. The closure of some sectors (hospitality and restaurants, retail except shops selling essential goods) and the recommendation for employees to work at home have not brought about the diminution in new infections. The unfavourable outcome raises concerns about the health and safety measures in companies. It is questioned how much the continued operation of the industry contributes to the spread of infections. For answering this question, The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (GZS) organised the survey of 50 companies about the health and safety at the workplace. On the other hand, the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) made a survey of infected persons","_Gospodarska zbornica Slovenije_ (The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia, GZS) organised a quick survey of companies. On the ground of survey results, GZS reports that 0.8% of employees are absent from work due to COVID-19 infection and about 2% for other reasons (either the closure of schools or quarantine). According to GZS, the figures show that the spread of the virus is under control in the workplaces and that employers observe the safety rules recommended by experts for occupational medicine, the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ). The employer organisation thus pleads the government not to close down the industry and risk more economic damage than necessary.In contrast to GZS, dr. Žiga Zaplotnik (COVID-19 Tracker Slovenia, established by volunteering scientists) has proved that people have much more diverse contacts at work than in other social environments (household, school, leisure and the like), so for him the risk of infection is proportionally higher in workplaces. Moreover, The National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) surveyed 10,205 persons who tested positive for COVID-19. Among them, the largest share got infected in the workplace (every fourth participant in the survey). The average age of infected persons (between 45 and 54) supports this survey outcome. While slightly less than a quarter cannot say the location, more than 20% got infected in household and 15% in care homes or centres for people with disabilities. Newspaper Dnevnik wrote that 10% of persons surveyed continued to go to work despite having one of the coronavirus symptoms and 10% more although they were in high-risk contacts. Workers are afraid of losing their jobs, but this is not the main reason. Journal Mladina wrote that the Ministry of Health practically stopped tracing contacts and issuing quarantine decisions because of the lack of personnel. The second reason is that employer must cover 100% sick leave for persons who got infected in the workplace. Still, the worker must first prove it in a procedure similar to the ‘accident at the workplace’ procedure. In this procedure, the worker cannot be successful without employers’ consent. For instance, even health care workers who had worked with COVID-19 patients could not prove it. It was said that even if they had got infected in the workplace, it was due to their negligence.","In the second wave of the epidemic, many more persons continue to go to work compared to the first one, notwithstanding a much higher number of infections. It is estimated that during the first wave of epidemic in Spring 2020, only about 30% of employees worked at their workplace. During the second wave, the proportion is turned upside down: 30% work at home and 70% at their workplaces.Journal Mladina gives exact numbers on issuing quarantine decisions. In September, authorities issued about 6,000 quarantine decisions a month. Since 1 October, when the number of infections was extraordinarily growing, the number dropped to about 1,400 a month. A website Mešanec has started to collect testimonies of workers about health and safety at work.

The emergency agreement was concluded due to the huge reduction in airline bookings and travel due to the ongoing restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.,"The agreement involves pay cuts of up to 10% with a 4-year pay restoration period, as well as productivity and rostering arrangements. It states that the airline requires a 4-year timeframe to return to pre-COVID-19 profitability levels and to enable it re-build “the strength of balance sheet necessary for its business model in the highly cyclical aviation industry”.It is to run from July 1, 2020 – July 1, 2024 with a review of the arrangements by the parties in March 2023.Redundancies: “The thrust of measures agreed is to minimise redundancies through a combination of pay cuts of up to 10% restored over the term of the agreement, along with rostering changes including part-time, unpaid leave, weekend rosters and maximising the use of the COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme while it is available.”Pay Cuts and Pay Restoration: “During the gradual return to full schedules, Cabin Crew will be paid fixed pay proportionately for days worked at the reduced rates as per points II and III below.” Pay will reflect the volume of work available and will be spread “as evenly as possible amongst Cabin Crew in the base”. In the event that the Irish Government wage subsidy scheme payment (if applicable) is higher than proportionate pay, the higher amount will be payable.There will be no pay or cost increases or pay claims between 1 Jul 20 and 30 June 24.","Following on from the agreement signed in June and due to the continuing restrictions on airline travel, in November Ryanair wrote to Fórsa expressing its regret for assigning compulsory unpaid leave to staff for a period of 5 weeks in Dublin, blaming the move on the Government’s “failure to implement a coherent air travel policy”.Company HR committed to continuing to engage with the union “in relation to our Irish based crew, especially if there is any further deterioration in our schedules”.Fórsa’s assistant general secretary, Ashley Connolly, confirmed that a priority for the union will be to engage with the company, “as a matter of urgency, on returning staff in both bases to work in 2021”.The Fórsa/Ryanair Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) covering directly-employed cabin crew jointly acknowledges that further reductions in the flying schedule in Ireland means that redundancies could be required, “but Ryanair and Fórsa agree to consult and work to minimise any job losses while fully complying with all legal obligations on information and consultation.”",Trade unions; Company / Companies,Particular professions,Companies,"Forsa members balloted on the agreement and accepted it.

While the majority of people were asked to stay at home, our frontline workers went to work. Among them were our healthcare professionals who acted selflessly, putting their own health at risk, in order to care for their patients. We owe them, and all frontline workers, a debt of gratitude. These experiences will have taken a toll on many, which is why this online professional mental health service from turn2me is so important. This new service, which is funded by Sláintecare, is free for everyone who identifies as a frontline worker. I would strongly encourage any frontline worker who needs support to put their own health first and to use this service.”","Turn2me provides professional mental health support services entirely online. The new service for frontline workers is a peer support, instant chat service. Each session is facilitated by a mental health professional and supported by trained volunteers.There are 20 groups available each week and there are job specific groups available, as well as groups based on shared issues such as stress, burnout and how to maintain a healthy work life balance.  Groups are scheduled at different times in the day throughout the week to accommodate shift workers, and participants can remain anonymous when online. The content and timings of the groups were developed following consultation and discussion with frontline workers from different disciplines.Brian Holohan, Clinical Manager with turn2me, said; “Demand for turn2me’s services has increased significantly, at the peak of the pandemic earlier this year for example, demand  spiked by 386%. It has been challenging for everyone, but especially for our frontline workers. The adverse psychological impact of working in such stressful circumstances, while at the same time dealing with the reality of Covid-19 in their personal lives, should not be underestimated. There’s a large evidence base that peer support, like the service we’re launching for frontline workers, is effective and that it can also act as a helpful gateway for people who haven’t reached out for help before. If you’ve been struggling in any way, please know that you are not alone and that talking will help.

The firm then focused on supplying supermarkets and food retailers with beer for personal consumption, even creating a new beer called Lockdown Lager in homage to the government’s social distancing mandate. With around 70% of (non-production) staff on furlough during the first and second lockdowns, the company's two directors have foregone their salary for 2020, and other senior team members have also taken considerable pay cuts, with the COO and board members each agreeing to take a 50% pay cut so as to ensure there is money within the business to support as many jobs as possible. A number of furloughed staff asked to come back to work in the firm’s still operational distilleries. For those who remained on furlough, BrewDog worked diligently to keep open lines of communication with all furloughed staff, including blog posts, weekly updates on the business, pub quizzes and even sending a crate of beer to staff who can no longer work. Social distancing was introduced into the factories, with crates placed at every stage of the production line so staff can keep a safe distance from one another. One of the company's founders even shared a tutorial on how the firm has made face visors for its production staff.For those who remained on furlough, BrewDog has worked diligently to keep open lines of communication with all furloughed staff, including blog posts, weekly updates on the business, pub quizzes and even sending a crate of beer to staff who can no longer work.During full bar closure, the company also focused on supporting its community and customer base, aiming to ensure that there is still a sense of connection. It launched the BrewDog Open Arms; an online virtual pub which allows its customers to come together and enjoy a beer together. The virtual bar opened for the first time on Friday, 27 March, and featured a pub quiz, guided beer tastings, and live music. Held over Zoom, it attracted more than 1,000 participants, the maximum number permitted by the online meetings platform.In another move to support the community, the company has also used its vans to deliver meals (and sanitiser - see below) locally.The scarcity of hand sanitiser in the region around its headquarters in Ellon, near Aberdeen in Scotland, led BrewDog to dedicate its distillery to producing this important tool in the fight to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The first batch was distributed within a few days, free of charge, to healthcare services, charities, and other frontline workers.  The transition did come with challenges. Given the sudden demand generated by the pandemic, the pump bottles normally used to dispense hand sanitiser could not be sourced immediately, so the team solved this packaging dilemma by using containers they already had on the premises. The first batches of sanitiser were delivered in beer bottles.The pump dispenser bottles eventually arrived, and the distillery began running 24 hours a day. It developed the capacity to produce up to 12 hectolitres per day, the equivalent of 12,000 100ml bottles of hand sanitiser. By 28 April, the number of units donated had reached more than 250,000.  The gel made in the initial phase of production contained 69% alcohol, above the 60% minimum recommended by the UK Health and Safety Executive and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. In the subsequent phases, learning has prompted adjustments and improvements. In response to feedback from local hospitals that the alcohol content required for sanitiser used in clinical care is higher than that used by individuals, BrewDog worked with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) to meet that specification. On 3 April, less than two weeks after the first batch was produced, the company received approval and an order for the new version of the sanitiser, which has an 80% alcohol content.  Brewdog is now officially supplying NHS Grampian with hospital grade Hand Sanitiser.","As stated previously, the firm's employees are covered by the measures but the company has also aimed to create an online bar for customers (1000 attended the first Zoom meeting at the end of March) and has also helped in the community, delivering meals and hand sanitiser.",Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment; The COVID-19 risk group at the workplace; Other groups of citizens; Workers in essential services,Companies; National funds,"The measures include taking care of staff, the wider community as well as support for the NHS (free sanitiser was initially provided).

This includes  large MRI scanners, X-ray machines and equipment, which assists in the laboratory testing of blood and urine samples. Siemens Health has a workforce of 2,200 employees in the UK, who work in offices, factories and hospitals across the UK. Its operations have been impacted significantly the coronavirus pandemic; not only has production been affected by increased demand but given the nature of its business (i.e.: healthcare), it has responded to the crisis through sharing expertise on a voluntary basis.","One of Siemens Healthineers’ four factories in the UK builds blood gas analysers, which are used to monitor the oxygen content in a person’s blood. These have obvious utility as part of  the portfolio of tests available in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. There was obviously an increased demand for these important pieces of equipment from the start of the pandemic and thus, the organisation had to implement some fairly radical changes in shift patterns. However, this need to ramp up production had to be balanced with keeping a number of factory staff home because of their age or underlying health conditions putting them at increased risk of the virus. Other employees have been understanding, given the nature of the crisis, and have increased their working hours accordingly. The workers stationed in factories were classed as essential workers and continued to travel to work, but most office-based employees transitioned to working at home. Assessing the situation was a big task for the HR team, which organised the fast-tracking of occupational health assessments and identified all workers who were vulnerable, organising for them to shield at home within a day of the risk factors being announced.Siemens Healthineers does not manufacture ventilators, but the company did produce them around 15 years ago. The firm did not actually build units in response to the government's call for UK manufacturers to produce more of the essential machines via the ‘ventilator challenge’, but Siemens lent its people’s domain expertise. As an accredited medical device manufacturer that formerly produced ventilators, the company supported ventilator manufacturers to increase their output, and offered guidance on health and safety and regulatory requirements.**NHS volunteering**With a number of clinically trained staff on the business’s payroll, the organisation had to come up with a creative solution to allow them time off to work in the NHS at no cost to the health service. This was a challenge for the HR team, which ended up creating a special type of annual leave: the company now offers staff trained in disciplines from radiography to biomedical science up to two days a week (for up to 12 weeks) additional paid leave to work for the NHS. This is on the basis that the support is offered without remuneration from the NHS.","It applies to the UK workforce, some 2,200 workers.",Company / Companies,,Companies,"As the firm was directly supporting the NHS and assisting other manufacturers in the production of much-needed ventilators, it can be assumed that such practice would be widely supported.

It supplies water and water recycling services to almost seven million people in the East of England and Hartlepool.It describes itself as a purpose-led organisation and it was the first major utility in the UK to change its company constitution – the Articles of Association – to lock public interest into the way it runs its business, both now and for future generations. The organisation states that it works to bring environmental and social prosperity to the region it serves.As a supplier of an essential service, the organisation's stated priorities throughout the pandemic were to keep water flowing to customers, to protect and support its employees and wider supply chain, and to offer help and advice to customers who found themselves facing challenges of all types.The organisation also wanted to support its communities through the pandemic: it states that it is firmly embedded in those communities: the vast majority of its 5,000 employees live in the region, as do many of their friends and families. The organisation identified that in many cases, charities and small community organisations were running short of funds and practical help at the very time they were most needed them.Thus, as part of its stated purpose is to bring environmental and social prosperity to its region of operation, the organisation wished to restore a sense of wellbeing and security among these communities, whether through practical support or support for emotional wellbeing. As such, it sought to support projects that are having a positive impact on people and the communities in which it operates, allowing them to provide help and connecting people with the practical and essential support they need. Anglian Water also identified that its many connections through Business in the Community (the business-community outreach charity set up by the Prince of Wales to promote responsible business and corporate social responsibility) and in its supply chain could offer vital support and services, and that the organisation had the skills and experience to help facilitate that support.","To further these goals, Anglian Water brought forward the launch of its planned GBP 1 million Anglian Water Positive Difference Fund. The organisation states that it has always supported communities overseas through its  fundraising for the charity WaterAid, but that it was keen to do more in its own region, and had planned to launch the fund as part of a new social contract with its customers. The organisation's Board took the decision to bring the launch of the fund forward in response to the COVID-19 emergency. Thus, the fund has focused on those who are considered high risk (including people with pre-existing medical conditions and people over 60) or who find themselves in vulnerable circumstances as a result of the continuing threat of coronavirus.As part of this, Anglian Water began by fast-tracking over GBP 50,000 of the cash to front-line organisations in the immediate response to battle the pandemic. It then worked with UK Community Foundations, a charity it has partnered with in the past, to establish a framework and criteria for the fund. The remaining half of the Positive Difference Fund is to be released later in the year to meet emerging needs from the fallout from the pandemic. Eligible organisations have been able to apply to their local Community Foundation for grants of up to GBP 5,000.The first application for the Anglian Water Positive Difference Fund was received just hours after it launched and Anglian Water has now funded upwards of 60 groups across its region. The fund has already supported a wide range of organisations, each providing a vital service for those most in need in their community - from those providing hot meals for people sleeping rough, and groups combatting coronavirus fraud, to those adapting services for autistic children, and vulnerable adults, including telephone befriending for people with dementia and providing devices for adults with learning difficulties to reduce isolationAnglian Water has also been instrumental, through its regional leadership of Business in the Community (BITC), in setting up the National Business Response Network, a virtual notice board that promoted a brokerage service between BITC members and organisations in the community that needed help. Since then, more than 750 businesses have joined up to the National Business Response Network, including Marks and Spencer, Boots and Lloyds as well as smaller businesses. The Network has received more than 2,300 requests for help from community groups, local authorities, schools, charities and alliances, and has been able to match nearly 2,000 of those with businesses to provide resources such as food, social care, technology and logistical support.Moreover, additional support offered to customers has included financial advice, payment holidays, instalment plans, the use of income maximisation tools to signpost additional help, and the promotion and extension of its priority services register.In terms of its own employees, Anglian Water took the decision early on not to furlough anyone; however, it recognised that employees might still face financial difficulties and thus, it set up an independently funded Employee Assistance Fund. It also extended support to its  wider supply chain, including reducing the time taken to make payments, releasing more than GBP 5 million in March alone, helping to support and advise many small and medium-size suppliers with access to advanced procurement opportunities and supporting staff within some supply chain companies whose pay was reduced by their employer.","The Positive Difference Fund has now funded upwards of 60 groups across its region.

Enterprises and employers are free to implement whatever practices they deem fit as long as they remain within relevant legislation.An example of a more concrete practice initiated by the government and social partners is the opportunity for free coaching and advice from the Entrepreneurship Sounding Board Foundation (“stichting Ondernemersklankbord” or OKB). Usually this organisation charges a fee for advice and guidance to entrepreneurs, but in the context of the COVID-19 crisis this organisation offers its services for free. The support is reserved for entrepreneurs who are especially affected by the COVID-19 crisis though the criteria which an entrepreneur must meet to be allowed to follow the programme is not immediately clear. The government indicates that entrepreneurs should first consult the Chambers of Commerce for help or information and if they are in need of further support, to register with the OKB for further coaching and advice.","The OKB is a national network with some 300 advisors with entrepreneurial experience. The organisation targets SMEs and offers them support and advice on whatever issue or question an entrepreneur may regarding their business. The OKB emphasises a personal approach, where the entrepreneur is guided through the support programme, referred to as a soundboard trajectory (“klankbordtraject”).Advisory trajectories involve the personally tailored support from ex-entrepreneurs, individuals with entrepreneurial experience or who are experts in their areas. They offer support to an entrepreneur for a period of up to 6 months. The OKB also provides extra education and training where relevant, information and knowledge exchange. The OKB has 17 regions and regional organisations in the Netherlands, allowing advisors to offer regionally relevant support to entrepreneurs; these regional advisors and experts are coordinated from a central office in The Hague. The OKB requests a donation of €200 for each advisory trajectory in principle but is waiving this fee in lieu of the COVID-19 crisis. ","In terms of effectiveness, the OKB overall indicates that it has been active for some 40 years and hosts around 3,000 advisory trajectories per year. Of the participants, 85% of entrepreneurs indicated they are very satisfied with the OKB and the OKB contributes to preventing approximately 66% bankruptcies a year.

This enterprise, being in the more construction and industrial sectors saw its work come to a near standstill during the COVID-19 crisis; a lot of the enterprise’s work is international and this came under substantial pressure as well. The enterprise made use of the NLWerktDoor! platform to help its workers, engineers and technical personnel, to get short term work in other enterprises and similar sectors.","There is not much concrete information available about the measure.

Due to the COVID-19 crisis hosting usual events, with thousands of visitors at festivals or concerts was no longer a viable business activity; the numbers of visitors do not come close to covering the investment required for such activities.Mr. Koffman felt that especially during the crisis, people would be in need of distraction and entertainment.","MOJO’s festival director therefore shifted the delivery of the enterprise’s activities to be online.

Its services include helplines and ‘talking therapies’ provided to supported housing and safe havens. These are run by more than 400 staff across the UK. Unsurprisingly, it  has seen increased demand during the crisis, so ensuring staff still take breaks at home and offering internal wellbeing webinars has been key.","For MHM, the safety and wellbeing of its employees was paramount as the pandemic hit. With a spotlight shone on the country's mental wellbeing during lockdown, MHM remained open to support those in need. However, the charity had to “be creative” about how it would deliver these vital services safely. Luckily a good IT infrastructure, combined with most staff already having work-suitable laptops and phones, saw the MHM team working remotely to full capacity within 48 hours of lockdown being announced. Aside from those working in supported housing, all MHM staff are working remotely, with no staff furloughed or plans to furlough staff. MHM is also in the process – with the help of the NHS – of setting up secure software to avoid hackers gaining access to confidential online therapy sessions. MHM expected an increased demand for its services, and when lockdown was announced, the HR team turned their attention to employee health and wellbeing – especially for those taking crisis calls and offering emotional support to people in need. For example, all support line workers taking crisis calls are encouraged to take breaks while in the office. However, given the shift to homeworking, there was concern that employees would miss out on that time to decompress between calls. Thus, HR compiled wellbeing packs, which were delivered to all employees. These contained a reminder about the charity's Employee Assistance Programme and how to access it, as well as tips for working from home, alongside stress-busting and wellbeing tips to reflect social distancing. The charity also paired up with an external provider to give employees access to online therapies including CBT and stress management.  HR also started a weekly newsletter called Wellbeing Wednesday. The charity's L&D function has also run a series of webinars to help spread the wellbeing message for employees., focusing on emotional resilience, stress, anxiety, wellbeing and transformative learning.Managers have also been involved in internal webinars on the remote management of staff  wellbeing - how to have challenging conversations and then in general just how to manage people remotely. These were so well-received that the charity has started providing external webinars for other organisations wanting to improve their wellbeing training offering.At the start of lockdown, MHM was already in the process of opening two new facilities in Staffordshire and Kent, which meant the team had to induct and train more than 25 members of staff virtually.  IT and phone equipment were couriered to the new employees. The charity also changed all of its 'onboarding' processes to be via Teams and telephone. New starters were given one-to-one calls to ensure they were OK, as well as being talked through the charity's systems and the HR/payroll portal. The organisation’s external emotional support hotline – which received more than 65,000 calls and 3,000 web chats last year – has experienced increased demand during the pandemic. As a result, MHM is currently still recruiting for hotline support workers. For both new inductees and those yet to join the charity, there is a series of compliance-based training modules to complete. This consists of 12 units, such as professional boundaries, mental health awareness and lone worker safety. Usually, these would be done face to face but they have now all moved onto the e-learning portal. Employees are however asked to stagger their learning so that they don't overload. The system has a built-in alert if a zealous employee completes too many at once.","The charity's 400 workers are covered by the new measures.

As it was considering how it could safely repopulate its office assets, its own office practice was a good starting point. Those who returned initially were all volunteers, and this gave the organisation an opportunity to get the right procedures and facilities in place, trialling them ahead of a wider return to the office.","The organisation carried out some research amongst its employees, which covered how they were feeling in lockdown, when and how often they thought they might feel comfortable returning to the office and whether they would change their journey to work after the pandemic. BL found that whilst 11% regularly cycled to work prior to lockdown, an additional 10% were considering cycling all or part of their journey. This insight prompted a number of activities:* A group was set up to investigate physical changes that could be made to York House (its HQ) both in the short term (increased bike storage, additional drying facilities) and longer term (additional showers);* Changes were made to its policies and Ride2Work scheme and BL introduced CycleScheme to enable staff to buy a bike from a wider range of retailers and up to a higher value.* BL's HR team reached out to a number of key cyclists across the business to form the new employee led Bike Network.The organisation had a kick-off meeting of 10 initial members in June, spent July agreeing mission and objectives and then launched to the company in July. BL's priorities are helping new cyclists with getting started in London, route planning, providing information on where to buy kit and equipment and generally breaking down the barriers to cycling. The firm is also  running a buddying scheme where members of the network meet new riders to help them try out their route for the first time. The firm sent out details of the new British Land Bike Network in internal comms inviting employees to join and outlining how it will help the company with this initial return to the office.The firm states that it has a unique opportunity to step change the number of people choosing to ride to work. It’s all about breaking down psychological barriers like fear of other vehicles on the roads or getting lost, as well as physical barriers like fitness and other barriers around inclusivity – there are still far fewer women who choose to cycle to work than men, for example. The firm is applying for a small budget for its lending library of equipment and to run workshops on basic mechanics like changing an inner tube. It is also having discussions about sourcing some bikes that new cyclists can borrow to try out riding to work before needing to commit to spending hundreds of pounds. The network has been met with significant enthusiasm – from existing cyclists keen to help those who are nervous, to new riders looking for tips on how to get started.

Therefore, it was important to stimulate consumption with the aim to support the Danish shops, hotels, restaurants and holiday centres. To this end, FH and DA suggested that releasing the frozen holiday money would create a welcomed opportunity to increase consumption in the experience and leisure industry during the summer.FH and DA were the first to suggest that the frozen holiday money should be released.

Therefore the position paper has been prepared in this respect.                        ","According to the union clearly stated rules should apply as listed below.* Telework is to be clearly regulated through national regulation and/or collective agreements at all levels, especially where regulatory frameworks have not yet been established and where unions see it as necessary.* The voluntary principle is to be fully respected, meaning that workers should have the right to choose between teleworking or working at the office. All type of workers who can telework or where telework is applicable (including agency workers, workers on a short-term contract etc.) must have the right to telework, but also to revert back to the office (a physical working place should be available to all employees). * The working time needs to be in full compliance with national regulation and/or collective agreements. Working time conditions must be the same no matter where the work is carried out. More flexibility and autonomy should be in the advantage of the worker and his/her work-life balance, and not result in unpaid overtime, pressure to be flexible and always available, and huge psychological strains. * The right to disconnect must be fully granted and respected. In the context of a pandemic, solutions must be found for those teleworkers who have to shoulder care responsibilities due to closed facilities.* Telework should not increase gender inequality, but represent an opportunity for a better work-life balance for all workers. * The employer has to be the fullyresponsible for providing the workers with the necessary good quality equipment to telework, as well as to ensure the proper health and safety measures and pay the workers’ health and social insurances.*Teleworkers enjoy all the same rights as all other workers, including the benefits from the collective agreement, the right to contact and to join a union, the right to training and lifelong learning, the possibility to get promoted etc. Telework and office work must be compatible.* The employer must provide the training programs in order to equip workers with the necessary skills to telework. Training needs to be accessible to all and to be designed for different groups of disadvantaged employees. The employer must respect the privacy and autonomy of the teleworker. This means the limitation on the collection of data only to what is necessary, demand for a clear protection of worker’s personal data in line with GDPR, full transparency of the scope and use of data collected, human in control demand etc..* Employers should also be trained in order to better manage a work organisation based on telework and to fully respect workers’ rights and the demands listed above.* The employer must provide an additional allowance to cover the costs of telework (utilities, such as heating and electricity etc.) and maintain the same benefits (including meal vouchers etc.).",The number of workers concerned not known.,National government; Social partners jointly; EU level social partners,,Companies,"Trade unions support their own initiative, the reaction of employers' organisations is unknown.",,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://news.industriall-europe.eu/content/documents/upload/2020/11/637419067413075266_EN%20-%20Position%20Paper%20Telework.pdf

Digital workplaces using intelligent sensors can measure noise levels in real time and set parameters to ensure compliance with health and safety standards. Nevertheless, these technologies must be used in conjunction with traditional OSH tools, such as risk assessments, to ensure worker safety.* Data protection - the challenge will be to find the right balance between protecting both the respective worker’s personal data and the industries’ international competitiveness.

Shortly after, the government and the social partners concluded a tripartite agreement on a comprehensive wage compensation scheme for furloughed employees that would otherwise have lost their jobs. In some cases, companies succeeded in reorganizing their production into producing personal protective equipment such as hand disinfectant and face shields. In order to use and secure this potential the state and the Confederation of Danish Industry established a cooperation with the aim to find and encourage companies to change their production, if possible, to items that would benefit a severely pressed health care sector and hospital personell. ","After the lockdown of economic and educational activities on 12 March 2020 due to the rapid spread of corona virus, the Danish health sector, and in particular the hospitals, were in acute need of protective equipment for the personnel. Therefore, in order to be able to cope with the pressure at the hospitals, the Danish Medicines Agency (Lægemiddelstyrelsen) encouraged the industrial companies in Denmark to switch over parts of the Danish industrial production to the much-needed personal protective equipment. This was in particular gloves, lab coats, isolation clothes, face shields, surgical masks, hand disinfectant and important equipment for COVID-19 tests.Thus, on 23 March 2020 the Danish Medicines Agency launched a campaign, Denmark helps Denmark, in cooperation with the pharmaceutical industry and the influential employer and business interest associations, Confederation of Danish Industry, DI, and the Danish Chamber of Commerce, Dansk Erhverv, with the aim to coordinate the efforts of producing personal protective equipment in Danish industrial companies. On 27 March, the medicines agency announced that they had received more than 1,000 applications. DI will be the coordinator of the cooperation that also include the municipalities and regions. DI will systematise the companies and make sure to bring them in contact with the right authority, in order to ensure a correct assessment of the potential in the production reorganisation. ","When the applications to the campaign ‘Denmark helps Denmark’ reached 2,000, the Danish Medicines Agency announced that the municipalities and regions had taken over the coordination of the procurements and future applications.

","Danish Crown's test strategy has three parts. First, 10% of the employees at the production facilities must be tested every week to screen broadly for COVID-19 among the employees. The second part is testing of the employees who return from holiday or have been outside Denmark's borders on weekends. Last, a massive test effort is made if there is a suspicion of an outbreak. The test program means that some of Danish Crown's employees, when they come to work on Monday morning, will be asked to state in which country and which region they have stayed over the weekend. Normally, an employer does not relate to the leisure time of its employees in this way, but as stated in the press release, the corona situation is quite serious, and therefore Danish Crown has previously been in dialogue with the Food Association NNF. The tests used in the test program are ""quick tests"", where there are answers after 15 minutes.

In addition, there is a small number of employees in the chain's administration as well as the purchasing, warehousing and production unit in Copenhagen.  ","To compensate for the lost revenue, Letz Sushi bet heavily on increasing sales of take away from the restaurants instead. As part of this transformation, Letz Sushi therefore adapted their business model in a number of areas:* They ""trimmed"" the menu card with a focus on keeping the parts that sell best and are most take-away suitable (eg sushi rolls).* They optimized the flow in the kitchen so that the staff can efficiently produce and deliver take away, while complying with authorities restrictions and the recommendations. The company has for example looked at how parts of the food can be prepared in advance, how the kitchen is decorated (e.g. to make room for a lot of take-away bags), and how the employees are placed in the kitchen.* They focus on increasing revenue on weekdays. Discounts on take-away on weekdays have been introduced, and offers in the individual restaurant are targeted at the local audience. One example is restaurants located close to elementary schools that sell kid-friendly sushi rolls.* They have strengthen the local anchoring by engaging in local trade associations.","According to a report from the Danish Industry Foundation, the business model adaptation due to the corona crisis has been a success. In fact, Letz Sushi has managed to increase revenue by about 20 percent during the closure compared to the same time the year before.As part of success, the company has chosen to reorganize its restaurants so that the small restaurants now only provide take away, while the larger restaurants still have room for seated guests and at the same time provide take away.

Economic life was put on hold. Most important in the midst of this was that the health sector did not have sufficient virus test material or protective equipment for the personnel to deal with increasing hospitalization of corona-contaminated people. To this end, companies in the manufacturing industry sector realized that they could deliver some of the needed items by switching production. They already had the basic tools.  ","When the corona crisis broke out in full scale, the Danish health sector lacked equipment to face the thread of a rapid increasing number of patients at the hospitals. The majority of the most needed protective equipment was imported from China. Given the global demand for these items, an extra supply chain was necessary. At the same time, many Danish industrial companies lost their markets from one day to another and employees were furloughed in great numbers. However, a combination of state recommendations and personal ingenuity from many SMEs resulted in a major switch of existing production with the aim to supply the health sector with sufficient materials, such as clothing, hand disinfectant and face shields. Some examples:A Copenhagen based company with 10 employees, Signwork Print and Signs, made signs, boards and campaign products to trade fairs, industry shows, event companies and Copenhagen Airport. These companies were some of the first to be hit severely by close down, among other reasons due to the ban of assembly of more than 500 persons and the closure of airports. Plexiglass was one of Signwork’s main products. Inspired by the use of plexiglass to protect the employees at the cash registers in the supermarkets, the owner got the idea to make similar products including the needed face shields of plastic. His aim was to secure the business and keep workplaces. Within a week, the company changed the production and was able to deliver face shields and other plastic equipment to municipalities and companies. Bornholm Snaps makes and deliver liquor to restaurants and shops. The sales dropped immediately, and the company started to replace the fall in production of beverages with production of hand disinfectant, which in the first weeks after the serious outbreak of corona virus were an article in short supply in Denmark.The breweries Carlsberg and Albani delivered ciderbase with alcohol that could be turned into hand disinfectant. Plastic manufacturing companies of a broad scale, including the toy manufacturer LEGO, deliver face shields and other protective plastic products to the health sector. Other Danish MNCs have made their production facilities available for the authorities, e.g. Grundfos, and the pharmaceutical MNC Novo Nordisk makes corona tests for the state in one of their laboratories. The readiness is great, and so is the breadth of companies, which includes both large production companies and tailors at The Royal Theater, who sew surgical masks.","There is no particular evaluation or number about the use of the measure. However, it is obviuos that the single initiatives have been widely welcomed. The Danish Medicines Authority informed (as of 22 April 2020) that at least 2,000 companies had offered to change production to protective equipment, if needed.

On 17 May 2021, the government called on parties that had been involved in adjusting the aid packages in order to negotiate an agreement for the long-term unemployed population (defined as people that have been out of work for a year), which may find it harder to return to work when the Danish society opens back up post summer. The small population includes seniors and unskilled workers in particular. On 28 May 2021 the government and parties agreed to allocate DKK 159 million to a number of temporary initiatives to help the long-term unemployed get a foot in the labour market again.","The agreement concludes nine measures divided in to four areas of long-term unemployment:1. Initiatives targeted at the long-term unemployed over 50 years* Both private and public companies will be able to receive an additional grant of DKK 20 per hour if they employ a long-term unemployed over 50 years of age on the existing wage subsidy scheme (løntilskudsordning) in 2021 and 2022. DKK 23.6 million is allocated to this.* DKK 15 million are allocated this year and next year to a special fund for seniors, which can be applied for by job centres and unemployment funds for measures targeting unemployed seniors.* A trial period in 2021-2022 of extending the period of business internships from four to eight weeks for long-term unemployed seniors over the age of 50.2. Initiatives targeted at upskilling of the long-term unemployed* Additional DKK 25 million in 2021 to the regional educational fund, so more unemployed, including the long-term unemployed, can exercise their right to a single short course that quickly can convert to new jobs and industries. It is estimated that with the additional funding, approximately 3,500 job-oriented courses could be carried out in 2021.* A trial suspension in 2021-2022 of the normal reference period for six weeks of job-oriented training. This allows the long-term unemployed to exercise the right to job-oriented training throughout their benefit period until they are back in work. DKK 21.4 million is allocated to this.* Extension of the right to a real competence assessment (RKV) to skilled workers to also be available to skilled benefit recipients, cash benefit recipients and transitional benefit recipients outside the the introduction programme, which has also reached the age of 30. DKK 21.6 million is allocated for a trial in 2021-2022.3. Initiatives targeted at all long-term unemployed* DKK 25 million is allocated to extend the scheme of VEU (Adult Continuing Training Support) coordinators up to and including 2022. The coordinators' task is to ensure a good match between the companies' demand for skills and the upskilling of the unemployed.* DKK 7 million is allocated to extend an already ongoing experiment, which was launched in 2021 to also cover 2022. The experiment extends the maximum duration of the substitution job rotation from 6 to 9 months. This allows unemployed people to have longer period in a temporary agency – including long-term unemployed.4.

All employees in the private as well as the public sector that have possibilities to work from home are furloughed, but in companies where the work has to be made on the spot, the organisation of the work and the daily routines have had to be reorganised. The following are examples on changes in the organisation of work with the aim to prevent the spread of corona virus. They are from the beginning of the crisis.","The local SMEs in the manufacturing industry sector have had to find a way to keep production going on and at the same time to find a way to keep the employees healthy and safe and prevent the corona virus to spread in the enterprise. This has resulted in changes of the organisation of work in SMEs all over the country. The following examples, published 12 March 2020 in Horsens Folkeblad, are from Region Mid-Jutland. However, companies all over the country took more or less the same initiatives regarding changing business practices in order to cope with the rapid spread of the corona virus.The packaging producer, Envases Europa, in the small town of Hedensted, has 900 employees. Most of them works in production. Envases produces packaging for the food industry and is therefore an important supplier in the chain. As other manufacturing companies, they received general instructions from the authorities about how to secure the employees in the offices as well on shop floor. Envases has five factories with large areas. This made it possible to change the placement and organisation of the employees so that the stand with a safe distance between them. Containers with disinfection liquid are placed at strategical places. Employees do not eat at the same time. All clerical and administrative staff are working at home equipped with company ITC tools.At Boligbeton in the Løsning, that produces concrete elements for the construction sector, the production has also gone in ‘corona mode’ with the aim to keep activities and save workplaces as far as possible. In the daily staff canteen, half of the tables and chairs have been moved and self-service cancelled. The employees keep distance at shop floor and they take part in planning the work in day/night shifts including weekend shift, if wanted.  All office staff work from home, only employees in production meet on location. All meeting including meetings with customers are cancelled.Before all hotels were closed completely in March 2020, many tried to adjust the business to the first restrictions from the health authorities. Hotel Vejlefjord was one of them. Basically, the challenge was to get the guests to respect and follow the new necessary rules and keep distance and use hand disinfectants. To this end, the hotel opened all three restaurants at one time but took more than half of the tables away in order to keep a good distance. At this moment, early in the epidemic in Denmark facemasks were not obligatory yet. The buffet in the restaurant was replaced by dishes served at the tables. The hotel furthermore contacted The State Serum Institute go secure if something special had to be done regarding the thermal waters. ","Changing company practices whether it was changing of production, changing work organisation or introducing digital solutions became widespread very fast after the introduction of significant restrictions on business activities. No exact numbers exist because no authority or business organisation have collected documentation.

The scheme was introduced to ensure continued compensation for businesses that experience a large fall in turnover due to the corona situation for the period September 2020 to February 2021.The scheme is largely based on the compensation scheme that applied for the period March - August 2020 [NO-2020-10/730](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-10_730).,"The new compensation scheme applies to the same industries as the previous compensation scheme and is open to enterprises with a more than 30% loss in turnover as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Applicants must use an authorised accountant or auditor and the auditor or authorised accountant has to confirm the application before it is submitted. Companies with a fall in turnover of at least 30% can apply for a subsidy.

The company hired a new executive manager in January 2020. He should strengthen sales and marketing but after corona, everything stopped and the company had to dismiss five employees in April 2020. One of the main problems was that the manager could not meet the costumers in with marketing and sales meeting at their premises. He contacted the genstart.nu for advice and subsequently entered into a cooperation with a consultancy firm. Together they analysed the potential possibilities to act for the company and they agreed to set up a programme based on digital solutions and a more flexible organisation of work. Based on the initial session, the consultant and the manager prepared a strategy to improve Alcumatic's sales, marketing and strategy through three tracks:* Structured sales process. The manager puts a new pipeline management into use. * Hedging of development areas. The management team lacked a common picture of the company's strengths and challenges, which could form the basis for prioritising future development areas. An old ERP system needed to be replaced. * Additional sales through differentiation strategy. The consultant and the sales manager formulated 15 purchasing criteria, which focus on customer demand today and in the future, and how Alcumatic performs on these criteria in relation to their competitors (mainly from China). The purchase criteria are, among others, security of supply and environmental certifications.Genstartnu.dk is an initiative that the independent Danish Industry Foundation launched in the early spring of 2020. The aim was to help Danish companies the best possible way through the difficult economic and commercial conditions that the corona pandemic entailed. The Danish Industry Foundation financed the consultancy and advisory course. ","The sales manager has integrated the new tool for pipeline management into his daily sales work. The hope is that the new structured sales approach can increase the company's annual turnover by DKK 5-10 million (€0.66 - 1.33 million). To this end Alcumatic also reveived a grant for the implementation of a new ERP system via the program ""SME: Digital"".

While trade unions are protesting, the employer organisations are content with the measure. Trade unions announced to appeal the articles to the Constitutional Court. The Parliament took precocious measure against the possibility that the seventh COVID-19 is rejected on the public referendum. On 30 December 2020, it passed a decision which bans to call for a referendum regarding this law.","Articles 21 and 22 adds another reason for ordinary cancellation of an employment contract. When a worker fulfils the requirements for old-age pension, the employer may cancel the employment contract without any justification. The notice period is 60 days and the dismissed worker has the right to severance pay. The measure is dubbed ‘forced retirement’ by trade unions.

It is, they claim, also against the goal, set by social partners, to retain older workers in employment. Moreover, according to their estimation, the ‘forced retirement’ will trigger an additional outflow of €245 million in the pension fund.

These sectors were not only affected by the epidemic, but also by harmful decisions of the state apparatus. Here are few examples. During the epidemic, Ministry of Culture is not renewing ‘self-employed cultural workers’ status (and ignore expert commissions), so persons concerned lost social and health security in the situation of social hardship. Second, the same ministry has started eviction of 23 cultural and NGO organisations from the building at Metelkova 6 in October 2020, at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic. They are supposed to empty the building until 31 January 2021 and make space for the new Museum of Independence. Third, the Government Communication Office stopped paying Slovenian Press Agency (STA) for contractually agreed work in October 2020. Moreover, in public discourses, the three sectors are often stigmatised as parasites and accused of anti-governmental activities.","The seventh COVID-19 law (ZIUPOPDVE) introduces some measure which will temporarily reduce the damage done to these sectors. Article 66 provides the Slovenian Press Agency (STA) with due payments since October 2020 and further payments in 2021. Thus, the law resolved the issue of funding for at least one year.Article 64 passed the jurisdiction from the government to the Ministry of Finance and so make possible transfers of due payments to some cultural institutions. Film producers are mentioned as one group whose payments were frozen over the whole year 2020. As a consequence, they haven’t got payments for work done nor could they start new projects.Article 60 raises the percentage of income tax from 0.5% to 1% that taxpayers can give directly to the NGO of their choice. The problem was a complementary proposal to the one finally adopted. Namely, the government proposed to terminate the NGO Fund. While direct funding depend on popularity of one NGO among taxpayers, the fund (according to NGO network organisation CNVOS) assures equal allocation of funds across the territory and among social spheres. The public resistance forced the government to withdraw this proposal.Article 67 provides collective copyright management organisations with the right to allocate 25% of their funds to their members.

Parents who lose (part of) their income because they have to care for their children at home are entitled to compensation payments as long as the child is under the age of twelve or has special needs, and parents have no reasonable alternatives to childcare at home.The Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) introduced a change to German disease control legislation in December 2021. Compensation payment now also covers school or nursery holiday periods, holiday extensions and periods without mandatory attendance. ","Parents receive compensation payment for up to 67% of income lost, or a maximum of €2,016 for a maximum of ten weeks per working parent, or a maximum to twenty weeks for single parents. Funds are distributed via employers, who have to apply on behalf of their employees.The change reflects changing needs under new lock-down decrees introduced in December 2020. The new decrees extended schools' Christmas holiday period and made school attendance voluntary during the last week of school in December. The legislative change came into force on 16 December 2021. Parents can apply for compensation payment until the end of March 2021.","Germany's federal government expected around 1.36 million employees to make use of the measure (Handwerksblatt 2020).The initial measure only covered up to six weeks of lost income. In April 2020, the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB 2020) demanded an increase of the compensation payment to cover up to 80 per cent of income lost, and an extension of payments to cover up to ten weeks. The policy change of December 2020 partly reflects these DGB demands.A Government-commissioned study (BMAS 2021), based on a survey among sixty experts of social and labour market policy, found that experts attributed an efficient implementation but a moderate socio-economic effectiveness to this policy measure. The Government decision to provide compensation for lost income in case of school and nursery closures has efficiently benefited working parents. Working hour reductions, still, mean a macroeconomic loss in collective wealth.",National government,Parents in employment,National funds,"In April 2020, trade unions demanded various changes to the measure (DGB 2020), not all of which were reflected in the policy changes of December 2020.

With over 10 million employees working under Germany's short-time work scheme (_Kurzarbeit_) already back in May 2020, income top-ups such as child benefits, housing benefits or unemployment benefits have increased in importance (Focus online 2020). To improve the situation of low-income households, the government has eased access to the child benefit top up (_Kinderzuschlag_) in Summer 2020 and increased the top-up from January 2021. This is an additional social benefit on top of the regular child benefit (_Kindergeld_).","Families eligible for child benefits can apply for a top-up. The measure includes easier access to the top-up and an increase of the top-up from January 2021. Eligibility depends on various factors such as household income, housing cost, family size and the age of the children living in the household.The Government eased access to the top-up in Summer 2020 by increasing the savings threshold (_Zweites Familienentlastungsgetz_, July 2020). Low-income families can apply for a monthly top-up to their child benefits of up to €185 per child. In October 2020, the government decided to increase the amount to a maximum of €205 per child from 1 January 2021. ","A growing number of households make use of the measure. As of January, 2020, the number of children covered by the measure was 299,168 children. By the end of October of the same year, the number had increased to 888,398 children (Jugendhilfeportal, 2020). The policy impact has to be evaluated in interdependence with other social benefit schemes. The child-benefit top-up is one of over one hundred different grants or tax deductions provided for families in Germany. The benefits bureaucracy has increased in the course of the economic and social crisis that is accompanying the pandemic in Germany (ZDF, 2020). The broad variety of measures means that families face the risk of benefit repayment. Successful application for some measures disables eligibility for others (see Focus online, 2020).

Some changes were extended in December 2020, to last until December 2021.","The March 2020 changes to parental leave regulation made parental leave periods more flexible and ensured some income stability for working parents. According to the changes of MArch 2020, parents working in essential services (systemically relevant sectors) can shift parental leave into the future without any decrease in the amounts received. Parental leave periods have to be spent until June 2021. Working parents who face salary cuts due to the pandemic or pandemic response measures continue to receive the parental leave payment amounts based on their declared income at the time of application. These changes were valid until the end of 2020.New changes to parental leave regulation of December 2020 aimed for further income stabilisation for families. Income top-ups such as short-time work payments (Kurzarbeitergeld) or unemployment benefits do not influence the parental leave payment calculation. Parental leave payment is based on parents' declared income at the time of application. These changes are valid until December 2021.","Policy implementation is not working smoothly according to media reports. The main challenge in implementing the measure is a noticeable delay in payments. For example in Berlin, families wait almost seven weeks on average before receiving the payment (BZ 2020). The policy impact of the measure may include an unintended but severe decrease in female employment. Also in Berlin, seventy percent of applicants are mothers. Thirty percent are fathers (BZ 2020). As early as May 2020, a WSI study found that Germany's pandemic response is triggering a reduction in wages and working hours for women and thus widening the gender gap in pay and employment (Kohlrausch and Zucco, 2020).

The collective agreement provides for more funds to be allocated to increase the work motivation of police officers and increased opportunities for the trade unions to get more actively involved in dealing with key employee-related issues in committees, commissions and working groups. In addition, taking into account the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased workload, more attention is paid to the rest regime of police officers and conditions are created for general physical fitness exercises to be performed independently at a place and time convenient for police officers. This is aimed at improving the working conditions of police officers and increasing their social and economic guarantees in Lithuania both during and after the pandemic. The provisions of the collective agreement apply to all police officers and employees working under employment contracts.","The collective agreement provides for allocating payroll funds saved in institutions to motivate employees. Priority is given to remuneration for extra work. For example, employees replacing their colleagues for long periods when this is not provided in their employment contracts, and employees performing activities in excess of their normal workload, shall receive at least a 10% salary bonus. Similar bonuses or additional leave days shall be granted to staff appointed as supervisors.The collective agreement also provides for the possibility to grant a study leave of 10 working days to police officers who are in formal education and have been in service at the same police institution for at least three years. They shall be paid their average wage for this period.Taking into account the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, conditions are created for police officers to perform general physical fitness exercises, at least two hours per month, at a place convenient for them and at a time of their choice. The exercise hours will be included in their working time. The collective agreement also established police officers' entitlement to additional leave. For example, a trade union member with one child under 8 shall be given one extra day off in three months; likewise, a day off on the first day of an academic year shall be available to all police officers raising children under 14 in general education schools if the police officers are not entitled to additional rest days in accordance with Article 138 of the Labour Code. The collective agreement further provides for a greater involvement of the trade union in decision-making. For example, depending on the number of trade union members, the heads of units and divisions will be allocated paid service working hours per year for this activity. In addition, trade union members will be able to use up to 3 working days a year for training and workshops while receiving their regular salary for those days.The sectoral collective agreement will be in force until 7 December 2024 (subject to a possible extension of four additional years).",No information available.,National government; Social partners jointly,Particular professions,Employer,"Trade union representatives were very positive about the collective bargaining outcomes.

One of the events igniting the anger of micro, small and medium business owners was the modest size of the list of branches (originally only 38 NACE sections named) entitled to support under the Financial Shield 2.0, see case [PL-2021-1/1640](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/PL-2021-1_1640).As a result from December onwards there has been a trend of opening businesses despite sanitary restrictions in place. There were also numerous public pickets organised around the country under the banner of Strajk Przedsiębiorców (Business on Strike), a bottom-up type of social movement of business owners (showing also some political aspirations).","The movement does not have any specific demands. The agenda consists of general postulates such as relaxation of sanitary restrictions, more transparency and predictability in state policies regarding lock-down (the practice of making decision on day-to-day basis is a subject to strong criticism) and more substantial support for the business struggling to survive. Currently, the main action is to compile a list of business intending to seek damages from the government due to introducing sanitary restrictions negatively affecting business operations without proper legal basis (state of emergency has never been introduced in Poland since the first outbreak of COVID-19 and this is the main basis for the business owners to claim the restrictions are actually illegal).

Furthermore, weekly Corona tests for specific professional groups are to be provided via this ordinance. This includes - in addition to the previously mandatory tests in the health and social care sectors - employees in contact with customers (e.g. transport, retail); teachers and elementary pedagogues who have contact with children; warehouse logistics if the minimum distance cannot be kept; public services when contact to clients occurs; and professional sports (team and contact sports).Those employees who have not been tested must instead wear an FFP-2 mask. In the health and care sector, both tests and FFP-2 masks are mandatory when contact to patients/clients occurs.","Following the implementation of the ordinance, the federal-level social partners negotiated a general general collective in order to provide the necessary framework conditions for Corona testing for the concerned professional groups.The agreement was negotiated between the federal level social partners (the 'official' social partners Federal Economic Chamber WKO, Agricultural Chamber LKO, Austrian Trade Union Federation ÖGB and Chamber of Labour AK and in addition the Federation of Austrian Industry IV). This is the first general collective agreement that has been concluded in Austria since 1978 (as the sectoral level is the dominating level in collective bargaining). The agreement applies to all companies and its employees which are organised and represented by the mandatory WKO and for which the WKO may conclude collective agreements (i.e. those companies represented by voluntary employer organisations which conclude collective agreements on their behalf - e.g. the Association of Austrian Banks - are not covered by this general collective agreement). However, an extension order is planned, which would expand the validity to those companies not covered by the WKO and for which no collective agreement applies (a very small percentage).The general collective agreement came into effect on 25 January 2021 and regulates the following:* Regular Corona tests which are prescribed for certain professional groups (via the ordinance) must be carried out during working hours with continued payment of wages. If taking a test at the place of work is not possible, the time which it takes to take a test in public facilities (including travel time) is to be counted as working time.* Employees for who it is not compulsory to take a Corona test should take the test outside of working hours. If this is not possible, an exemption is possible (once a week).* Employees may not be disadvantaged or dismissed because of the participation in COVID-19 tests and in case of a a positive test.In addition to these clauses on tests, the social partners agreed upon a mask-free time for those employees who are required to wear a mask during their work (due to legal regulations). After three hours, those employees may take off the mask for at least 10 minutes. This is not a mandatory break time, but the employee can change the work (e.g. no customer contact) or timing can be arranged so that this mask-free time falls within a regular break.",No estimates available.,Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Employers' organisations,Employees in standard employment,No special funding required,"Due to the fact that a mutual agreement was concluded, it can be assumed that both sides are supportive of the measure.",,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.kollektivvertrag.at/kv/general-kv-corona-test-arb-ang/general-kv-corona-test-rahmen/438328?term=general; https://www.wko.at/service/kollektivvertrag/erlaeuterungen-generalkollektivvertrag-corona-test.html#heading_2; https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20210115_OTS0160/sozialpartner-general-kv-zu-eintritts-und-berufsgruppentests-ist-wichtiger-meilenstein-auf-dem-weg-aus-der-krise; https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Coronavirus---Aktuelle-Ma%C3%9Fnahmen.html; https://www.vida.at/cms/S03/S03_0.a/1342644413425/home/artikel/zusatz-kv-fuer-privaten-pflege-und-gesundheitsbereich
AT-2021-14/1742,Home office regulation,Gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen für Home-Office,Austria,Applies nationwide,04/01/2021,12/31/2023,Temporary,Legislations or other statutory regulations,Entirely new measure ,"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","Teleworking arrangements, remote working",01/27/2021,"Home office work was not very wide-spread in Austria before the onset of the pandemic. With the onset of COVID-19, this changed. According to the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB), around four out of ten employees in Austria have been doing mobile work (on and off) since then. The vast majority of these employees have worked in their home offices.Home office work was first recommended by the federal government in spring 2020, amid the first lock-down in the country (see case [AT-2020-12/590](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-12_590)).With the prolongation of the health crisis, it has become clear that home office work will remain part of employees' working lives and many businesses will rely on also in the future, when the crisis is over. Due to the lack of specific legislation, the social partners already started to negotiate on a home office package in September 2020. Tripartite meetings with the government were held in September and December 2020 and in January, an agreement was found. Legislation came into effect on 1 April 2021.","The legislation put forward is colloquially called a 'home office' law in Austria, but it is not a stand-alone law, but rather a package of several measures. Existing legislation regarding - among other areas - labour law, tax law, income law, or social security law was amended with clauses on home office work.The following provisions have been put into legislation:* Home office work is to be agreed upon between employer and employee (in writing), i.e. there is no unilateral obligation or right to do work from home, but home office is voluntary. Both sides (i.e. employer and employee) have the right to withdraw from a home office agreement in the future. The agreement can also be terminated in case of important reasons (e.g. change in family situation, living situation) with one month's notice. Works agreements on home office can be concluded (in companies with a works council), but this is not obligatory.* Workplace: According to the legislation, work in the home office occurs when people work in their home (including  secondary residences or the apartment of a close relative or partner). Thus, mobile work in public places (like co-working spaces, cafes, parks) does not fall under the home office regulations.* Equipment and office supplies: The employer is obliged to provide the necessary digital work equipment, but employees in the home office can agree to use their own work equipment (i.e. their own laptop or private cell phone, internet connection). If they do so, they are entitled to an appropriate reimbursement of their expenses, e.g. in the form of a flat rate (either determined case-by-case or in a works agreement). * Tax regulations/flat rate payments: Such (flat rate) payments (mentioned above) by the employer  are tax-free up to €300 per year (up to €3 per home office day, up to 100 home office days per year). If the lump sum is not exhausted by the employee, he/she can claim the difference up to this maximum of €300 as income-related expenses. In addition, the employee can tax-deduct the costs for the purchase of ergonomic office furniture up to an amount of €300 per year (also in effect retrospectively for 2020).* Damage to work equipment: The provisions of the Employee Liability Act are also to be applied in the home office (including damage done by household members or pets). The extent of the compensation is reduced or omitted entirely.* Health and safety/ergonomics: The  employer is obliged to ensure that the workplace at home is ergonomically designed and that questions relating to safety and health protection are answered and clarified. The social partners are currently working with the Labour Inspectorate to develop information materials. * Working time/working hours: All provisions of the Working Hours Act, the Rest Period Act and the applicable provisions of the Employee Protection Act also apply in the home office. That means that - unless otherwise agreed - the same working hours apply at home as they would in the office.

As part of the pilot project, the company also tested the delivery of consignments using taxis. The company has been operating in the Czech and Slovak markets since 2013.","Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the company recorded a decrease in transport services by 34% in 2020, when the demand for passenger transport fell to 10 to 15% in the spring of last year alone. The company managed to mitigate the decline in sales by starting to transport consignments in addition to passengers. The number of shipments delivered during 2020 was less than hundreds of thousands. This represented an increase in the number of delivered consignments by 6,000% compared to previous years when the company tested the delivery of consignments by taxi.

This was a result of the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has shown Europe's dependence on the import of a range of essential chemicals for domestic production, in particular drug production. Therefore, the strategy aims to reduce this dependency by providing open strategic autonomy with resilient value chains.According to the European Trade Union IndustriALL, implementation of the strategy will have the greatest impact on the production, processing, management, reuse and discharge of chemicals since the introduction of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation. Therefore, the strategy must be formulated and shaped with careful assessment of the socio-economic impact.","IndustriAll Europe supports the aim of phasing out most harmful substances for non-essential societal use, but  calls for a mindful process of defining “essential” and “non-essential”. Trade union also warns that terminology such as “toxic-free environment” creates wrong expectations. In many cases, the toxic properties of substances are their very asset. Sanitisation for example, so important in the battle against the spread of the coronavirus, would be impossible without “toxic” substances.IndustriAll Europe agrees with the Commission’s analysis that chemicals are the building blocks of low carbon, zero pollution and energy- and resource-efficient technologies, materials and products. The green and digital transitions of our economies and societies depend on the innovative capacity of the chemical(s) industry.However trade union expresses its surprise that the role of workers is virtually absent from the strategy. Therefore amongst key demands for the improving of the strategy  is an encompassing impact assessment of the potential effects of the strategy’s elements on employment, on the people who research, produce, process, manage, etc.; and solutions for possible negative impacts.",n.a.,"National government; EU (Council, EC, EP)",Sector specific set of companies,No special funding required,Trade unions support their own opinion.,,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://news.industriall-europe.eu/content/documents/upload/2021/1/637460585874631534_iA%20position%20Chemicals%20Strategy%20for%20Sustainability%20EN.pdf

In 2021, this will increasingly include vaccine doses and personal protective equipment. The ETF and ECSA therefore call on EU authorities and governments to ensure that seafarers are recognized as key workers in all EU Member States.The European Transport Workers’ Federation is a pan-European trade union organisation which embraces transport trade unions from the European Union, the European Economic Area and Central and Eastern European countries. The ETF represents more than 5 million transport workers from more than 200 transport unions and 41 European countries.The European Community Shipowners’ Associations is the umbrella organisation of the national shipowners’ associations of the EU, the UK and Norway.

ECSA’s prime task is to represent the overall interests of the European shipping industry with the institutions of the European Union. ","ETF and ECSA strongly call on EU Member States and EU Institutions to ensure that seafarers and maritime personnel should, in line with the key worker status, continue to be exempted from restrictions being put in place, like quarantine and pre-arrival testing requirements. This to ensure they can travel to and from EU Member States for the purpose of crew changes, shore leave or repatriation.Social partners stress that even with priority access to vaccinations, it will take some time before all seafarers will be vaccinated. During this period seafarers and maritime personnel should not be subjected to any requirement to have been vaccinated for entry to or travel within the EU.Social partners stressed also that European flag states have a particularly important role to play in leading by example in facilitating crew changes in their ports and supporting their flagged vessels in efforts to undertake crew changes and repatriations globally.",n.a.,EU level social partners,Cross-border commuters; Sector specific set of companies; Companies providing essential services; Other businesses; Workers in essential services,No special funding required,The social partners support their own initiative,,,Yes,Not specified,H50 Water transport,Yes,"Labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport",,https://www.etf-europe.org/resource/etf-ecsa-letter-on-crew-changes-and-vaccinations-210121/

The right to perform the test is once every 3 days. PCR tests are also free, but only at the request of the attending physician. The government of the Czech Republic has recommended that testing be carried out by private companies as well, with some form of state participation being considered in the future, which has not yet taken place.","Many companies have begun testing employees with antigen tests at their own expense. One of them is the carmaker [Škoda Auto, a.s.](https://www.skoda-auto.cz/), which performs approximately 2,500 PCR and antigen tests per month.

Consequently, the minimum pay will grow from €940.58 to €1,024.24. In December 2020, employer organisations requested a temporary suspension of the Minimum Wage Act, saying the wage increase will burden the economy. They proposed the inclusion of suspension in the seventh COVID-19 law. As a response, trade unions announced a general strike. The law (ZIUPOPDVE), adopted on 29 December 2020, did not include the suspension and negotiations on the tripartite level continued in January 2021. The result was a compromise solution – a partial reimbursement of the minimum wage increase by the state.","By applying this solution, enacted in the Act on Additional Measures for Mitigation of Consequences COVID-19 (ZDUOP) on 3 February 2021, the government took over the burden to cover a part of the minimum wage increase in 2021. The measure aims at helping businesses to stay afloat.From January to June 2021, the government will give €50 a month for each worker whose full-time salary without variable pay and bonuses does not exceed the minimum wage. From July to December 2021, employers will benefit from reduced social contributions.Partial compensation of the minimum wage increase puts some limits on beneficiaries. During the measure and three months afterwards, they cannot dismiss workers (for whom the company receive the state subsidy) or carry out collective dismissals. In 2021, they cannot pay dividends, buy their own shares, pay performance bonuses or awards to managers. If it happens, they must report to the Financial Administration for return or risk high fines.","The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia estimates the state will compensate 30% of the minimum wage increase.Between January and 20 May 2021, the Financial Administration paid €10.8 million for minimum wage subsidies. Each month, about 8,000 employers send a request for subsidies.

The case in question is the Nationwide Building Society, which employs around 18,000 staff in the UK, across numerous locations, encompassing 650 branches, six contact call centres and the organisation's HQ in Swindon. ","The organisation's principal priority was ensuring the safety and security of its 18,000 staff across its many branches, contact centres and HQ in Swindon. Whilst 13,000 of those employees were/are able to work from home, its branches constituted an ‘essential’ service and thus, have remained open throughout the pandemic, serving the organisation's millions of customers. As well as putting all the expected measures in place to keep branch staff safe, the staff from the HR department directly consulted with staff, so as to ask them what they felt would make their roles easier . This was found to include allowances for provisions, given that most food outlets were closed in the first lockdown. Those working in contact centres were also provided with free lunches and hot drinks. In addition, Nationwide also made some significantly larger promises to its staff during COVID. Vulnerable employees with health conditions were told by the CEO not to go into work if they didn’t feel safe doing so. Thus, more than 2,000 people shielded at home for this reason during the first peak of the pandemic. The organisation also offered a ‘job promise’ to all its staff that their role would be secure until at least the end of 2020. This was an effort to ensure that staff had income security until at least the end of the year.With changes to business areas already having happened because of COVID, and more afoot in 2021, this has naturally led to new thinking about redeploying staff internally. Nationwide’s ‘flex force’ initiative has intensified redeployment efforts and has underpinned the retraining of employees to allow successful moves to other departments. The Head of HRD at the organisation has said that the pandemic has helped to remove barriers around reskilling and flexible approaches. She argues that managers have accordingly changed their own perceptions around reskilling and redeployment. The organisation has also turned this new flexible mindset to recruitment, and to thinking as to how its people will work best post-COVID; this has in turn boosted its already considerable efforts around inclusion and diversity. In 2020, the organisation virtually on-boarded and inducted 80 new starters on either apprenticeships, graduate schemes or work placements, who ordinarily would have been required to attend an in-person induction at Swindon. The firm also hired its most recent cohort of contact centre staff completely remotely, so recruits could be based anywhere in the UK and still successfully execute their role. This signals a shift in thinking as to where future employees will be based; the HRD Director states that the organisation will in future be seeking those who can add most value but aren’t necessarily able to come into an office every day.  Also this year, the organisation has invested in its culture programme, aiming to become more diverse and inclusive. Thus, for instance, more than 5,000 staff took part in a series of events to mark Black History Month in October, and the firm has implemented a sponsorship programme to develop underrepresented talent, as well as working on developing its staff diversity networks and giving them the opportunity to feed back to the board. Following comments from these networks, it has also purposefully taken a strong external stance against racism, which reportedly has emboldened employees.

Since launching in 2008, the platform not only advertises around 40,000 jobs each year, but also has an applicant tracking system that helps councils streamline their hiring process.But when the pandemic hit and the prime minister issued his ‘stay at home’ message, the organisation saw an almost overnight move from 5% of public sector staff working from home to more than 80%. Their issue was that there were numerous people within recruitment processes but that COSLA could no longer arrange organise face-to-face interviews as part of those processes. With vacancies still needing to be filled despite the lockdown restrictions, the organisation had to quickly come up with an alternative process, all the while further hindered by the usual challenges of tighter council budgets and limited resources.","Like many organisations, COSLA considered making use of popular videoconferencing platforms as a virtual alternative to conducting interviews.

Instead, the project coordinators realised that their  current system offered the option for candidates to add a video as part of their application, and so piloted using this with 10 councils. Candidates were asked to put a video together, answering questions they would usually be asked at the interview stage. Not only was this a relatively quick process to roll out, but all the data could be tracked, and hiring managers just had to log in to the system as normal to view it, which saved COSLA time spent on training.","To date, more than 5,200 candidates have produced a video as part of their application process, and 253 roles across Scotland have been filled using this system over the last year.COSLA found that the new process created greater efficiency when recruiting. For example, the time to offer for vital home career vacancies reduced from 74 days to 15 days, and time to hire decreased from 119 days to 44 days.Feedback from candidates has also been positive: one applicant with dyslexia said they relished the opportunity to not type out lengthy text responses. It also highlighted how “archaic” the recruitment process was before and that the change in practices imposed by the pandemic could be the shift needed for what is typically a very traditional sector to become more digital in the future.Moreover, given how varied public sector jobs are, managers have been generally positive about the addition of video to the application process.  They have found that it provided them with a real insight into the candidate and gave recruiters an idea of candidates' soft skills. The organisation now plans to work with the remaining councils so as to roll out the new system.

GB-2020-12/1789,Digital Learning and Development at NHS Blood and Transplant service,,United Kingdom,Applies nationwide,03/20/2020,,Open ended,Company practices,New aspects included into existing measure,"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace",Changes in work organisation,03/11/2021,"in 2018, NHSBT's maturity in digital L&D was low. The 'digital team' was two people who were previously classroom trainers who had dabbled with tech to do some videos and some limited  e-learning. The appointment of a new L&D Director meant a shift to digital learning. By 2020, the digital L & D team is now six-strong, comprised of learning technologists, people with teaching backgrounds and with instructional design backgrounds, with people from the business who have worked in the scientific and blood donation areas of the organisation.This shift proved crucial during the pandemic, given that NHSBT’s services – and the skill levels of its 5,500 staff – were crucial to maintain during the pandemic. While many predominantly office staff have been able to conduct their roles from home, most of those working across the organisation’s blood, transplant, diagnostic and therapeutic services and its clinical research side have remained very much on the frontline.Moreover, the numbers of staff working directly with the public have in fact increased, with the body heading the NHS’s convalescent plasma trial – a drive to get those who’ve recovered from coronavirus to donate blood plasma to test whether these antibodies can help people struggling to develop their own immune response (with significant stocks built up and ready for immediate use, pending trial results).","The organisation had to recruit more than 600 donor carers and nurses during phase one. These new staff joined from a range of sectors and scenarios, including people on furlough, pilots and crew, retail nurses and retired NHSBT staff returning to help. It would usually be a six-week onboarding and induction programme, but it had to be done in three weeks. Thus, the digital L&D team dropped everything to support the education teams to put a digital learning path and content together that could be made available to people before they even got access to IT.The digital L&D team’s main responsibility is building learning solutions and providing guidance to, and connecting, education leads across the organisation, who in turn are responsible for teams of facilitators and trainers in their particular areas.  It has to be this way, given NHSBT’s diversity, and the need for specialists to deliver specialist training. There are not just people in  very different roles but also working in different environments with different access to technology.In 2019, mandatory training had been refreshed and NHSBT’s management and leadership programmes - previously traditional classroom courses that could take up to six months to book on to - were digitised. This meant that when all face-to-face courses had to be stopped under the pandemic, people in the organisation can now access tools and technology they can work with every day, by getting curated content fed to their inboxes.Prior to the pandemic, the team had digitised 42 L&D products overall, including a project introducing virtual reality to teach a blood identification module. So NHSBT was in an excellent position to deliver learning virtually when COVID struck. While some training is still taking place face to face, in the form of frontline colleagues coaching each other, much is moving online. As such, the team has already worked on 55 products this year, with its agile methodology coming to the fore.It’s a way of working the organisation is keen to hang on to. There is a shift in approach: whereas previously, all products would be piloted fully, this can't be done for everything during COVID. There was a need to get learning products live and then iterate and improve continuously.","The organisation has around 5,500 employees. It is not known how many have utilised the new digital L&D products.",Company / Companies,Particular professions; Companies providing essential services,Companies; National funds,No views expressed.,,,Yes,Only public sector,Q86 Human health activities,Yes,Health professionals,,https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/voices/case-studies/How%20nhs-blood-and-transplant-investment-in-digital-LD-has-proved-vital-during-covid

Many recipients of unemployment benefits work occasionally and therefore combine unemployment benefit with a salary. A recipient of unemployment benefits can earn a certain amount without it affecting the benefits. If the monthly salary exceeds this exempt amount (in Finnish ‘työttömyysetuuden suojaosa’), the unemployment benefit is reduced.With the aim of supporting people who have become unemployed as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and facilitate combining work and unemployment benefits, the Government decided to increase the exempt amount.The legal basis of this measure is Act 492/2020 that amends the Act on temporary exceptions to unemployment security as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (free translation) (in Finnish ‘Laki väliaikaisista poikkeuksista työttömyysturvalakiin COVID-19-epidemian vuoksi annetun lain muuttamisesta 429/2020).","In normal circumstances, the exempt amount is €300 per month. It has been temporarily raised to €465 (gross amount) for those recipients whose unemployment benefit is paid out every four weeks and €500 in case the benefit is paid on a monthly basis.This measure covers all unemployed job-seekers who are entitled to unemployment benefits (labour market subsidy or earnings-based and basic unemployment allowance).There is no information about the total budget but the Government estimated in its proposal (HE 14/2021) (in Finnish) that the extending the duration of this measure by three months in 2021 leads to an additional cost of approximately €19 million.This duration of this measure has been extended several times.",No information available.,National government; Social insurance,,National funds,"Akava, a peak-level social partner representing employees with academic education, welcomed this measure in May 2020.

While the law gives employers the right to request telework from employees in cases of natural or other disasters, it fails to specify it. On 5 March 2020, the Ministry for Labour, Family, Social Affairs, and Equal Opportunities (MDDSZ) issued recommendations on what employers should specify by requiring telework (types and range of work, working time, mandatory availability of worker, control over work and reporting, means of work, health and safety at work …). Employer organisations have proposed to simplify the procedure, as reported in [SI-2020-24/1102](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SI-2020-24_1102).

In terms of new cases, active cases and deaths, each of these three wave was worse than the one that preceded it. Whilst the first wave of cases resulted in the closure of several businesses, such closures were limited between July 2020 and February 2021. One sector which was forced to close during this period were bars and related businesses. On August 17, bars and nightclubs were closed (but bars where patrons are seated and food is served as well as restaurants were excluded). On October 29 2020, bars were ordered to close (this excluding snack bars and kiosks, which were not allowed to sell alcohol and also had to close between 11pm and 5am). Subsequently, in January and February 2021 Government announced state measures which provided financial assistance to bars.

Those in Category A would receive additional aid of €717, thus receiving a total payment of €3,587. Those in Category B will receive an additional €465, thus receiving €2,325 in total.

In fact, it is only granted for the recruitment of employees aged under 30 on the date the contract is concluded.**Length of the scheme**This scheme only covers apprenticeship or ""professionalisation"" contracts concluded between 1 July 2020 and 28 February 2021. But this aid has been extended (see update below).**Amount of the financial support**The amount of aid for hiring work-study students varies according to the age of the employee and reaches:* €5,000 maximum for an employee under the age of 18. When the student reaches the age of majority, the aid will be increased to €8 000 from the first day of the month following his or her birthday;* €8,000 maximum for an employee aged 18 or over.With this measure, the cost of recruiting an employee on a work-linked training scheme is considerably reduced. The aid covers almost 50% of the salary of a young person under 18 on a professionalisation contract and more than 65% for a young person between the ages of 18 and 20. The aid covers 100% of the salary of an apprentice under 21 years of age and 80% of the salary of an apprentice between 21 and 25 years of age.","According to the Ministry of Labour, nearly 1.3 million young people under 26 were hired on permanent or fixed-term contracts of more than three months between August and January this year, of which 340,000 have so far applied for aid. The cost between July 2020 and 31 March 2021 is estimated at €803 million.However, the aid will not have been enough to maintain the level of hiring of young people. Thus, according to DARES, in February 2021, the hiring of young people under 26 on permanent and fixed-term contracts of more than three months was lower than in February 2019 and February 2020, by 10% and 19% respectively. For young people under 30 as a whole, the decline in hires is similar (-11% and -19% respectively compared to February 2019 and 2020).Over the period August 2020 to February 2021, the number of cumulative hires reaches 1,399,000 for young people under 26 years of age on lasting contracts. This is 8% lower than the figure for the same period a year earlier. the same period a year earlier. The decline is 10% for young people under 30.

In the text send by  for the consultation of the social partners, the government indicates [SRC.PT/3546] that the measure is intended to prevent unilateral decisions aimed at the expiry of collective agreements, taking into account the following arguments:  * The negative impact of COVID-19 disease pandemic in collective bargaining: in the 2nd quarter there was an abrupt year-on-year decrease in both the number of published agreements (-62%) and the number of workers potentially covered by them (-72%), a trend that was maintained in the months of July and September, with decreases of 30% of published agreements and 73% of workers covered. Overall, in 2020, were published 118 collective agreements (-34% than in 2019) with 336,694 workers potentially covered (-49% than in 2019). * The unequivocally high exposure of collective bargaining to uncertainty and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic and its economic and social effects; and the fact that the retraction of confidence and perspectives of economic actors often translates into a lesser propensity for negotiation and renewal, which can also lead to an increase of unilateral decisions on the expiry of collective agreements.","The Law no. 11/2021 of 9 March 2021 suspends exceptionally, for a period of 24 months, the deadlines - provided for in article 501 of the Labour Code, approved by Law no. 7/2009, of 12 February - concerning the survival of collective agreements. It applies to:* Survival periods following the termination of a collective agreement carried out after the entry into force of this law; * Ongoing survival periods, following the termination of a collective agreement carried out on a date prior to the entry into force of this law.The Law applies to collective bargaining in the private sector and in public owned companies but not in public administration.",All salaried workers and companies in the private sector and public owned companies.,National government; Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Employers' organisations; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,No special funding required,"* The employer confederations CIP, CAP, CCP and CTP [SRC.PT/3557; SRC.PT/3559; SRC.PT/3561; SRC.PT/3562] expressed their disagreement with the limited time and procedure of consultation in the context of the tripartite Standing Committee for Social Concertation (CPCS) - arguing it did not gave room enough for a real exchange of views  - and expressed their strong disagreement with the content of the measure. * The trade union confederation UGT  [SRC.PT/3560] agreed with the content of proposed measure - tough claiming both the suspension of the deadlines of survival and expiry of collective agreements. Also UGT highlighted that the consultation procedure did not favor a real social dialogue.* The trade union confederation CGTP  [SRC.PT/3553] stressed that what would be appropriate would be the revocation of the Labour Code rules allowing unilateral expiry of collective agreements. CGTP claims the reinstatement of the fundamental collective bargaining rights, which implies the revocation of the rules that weakened this right, namely those regarding the expiry of agreements, and claims the reinstatement of the principle of more favorable treatment for the worker; and asked the guarantee that the Government does not publish any notice of termination agreements, until these rights are reestablished.",,,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://dre.pt/application/file/a/15908791; https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063446f764c324679626d56304c334e706447567a4c31684a566b786c5a79394562324e31625756756447397a5357357059326c6864476c325953396c4e7a5978596a673259693079595459344c5451795a544d7459574e6c595330304f5749305a4467795a6a41784d5451756347526d&fich=e761b86b-2a68-42e3-acea-49b4d82f0114.pdf&Inline=tru; https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063446f764c324679626d56304c334e706447567a4c31684a566b786c5a79394562324e31625756756447397a5357357059326c6864476c325953387959574d304e6a67774e79316b4e47526d4c5451314f5759744f44426b4e4330354f444d334e6a426a4d4463785a5463756347526d&fich=2ac46807-d4df-459f-80d4-983760c071e7.pdf&Inline=tru; https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=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&fich=CIP-+Confedera%C3%A7%C3%A3o+Empresarial+de+Portugal.pdf&Inline=tru; https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063446f764c324679595842774f6a63334e7a637664326c756157357059326c6864476c3259584d7657456c574c33526c6548527663793977634777324d793159535659745957356c654738744d7935775a47593d&fich=ppl63-XIV-anexo-3.pdf&Inline=tru; https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063446f764c324679626d56304c334e706447567a4c31684a566b786c5a79394562324e31625756756447397a5357357059326c6864476c32595338334e6d5132595463325a53316c4d5459354c5451355a5455744f5452694d7930324e7a49355a4759304e6a63774e6d45756347526d&fich=76d6a76e-e169-49e5-94b3-6729df46706a.pdf&Inline=tru; https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063446f764c324679626d56304c334e706447567a4c31684a566b786c5a79394562324e31625756756447397a5357357059326c6864476c3259533834595463775a6a67305a4330334e546c6c4c54517a4e6d49744f5752685a6930794d6d59304d4451344d7a457a5a6a55756347526d&fich=8a70f84d-759e-436b-9daf-22f4048313f5.pdf&Inline=tru; https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063446f764c324679626d56304c334e706447567a4c31684a566b786c5a79394562324e31625756756447397a5357357059326c6864476c32595338324d6d55794d6a686b4d7930774d4752684c54526c5a6a5974596d5a6a4d6931695a44426d597a4a6a4d4745305a6d51756347526d&fich=62e228d3-00da-4ef6-bfc2-bd0fc2c0a4fd.pdf&Inline=tru

As this mode of work has proven to be effective, companies plan to continue teleworking after the end of quarantine. In this context, they offer their employees one-off grants for improving their workspace at home. One of such companies is Danske Bank, which announced on 1 April 2021 to provide grants to employees so that they can set up a comfortable and safe workspace at home.","Danske Bank has announced that it will provide a €700 extra payment for all employees to set up a workspace at home. As the latter amount will be subject to taxes, each employee should receive around €410 net upon request.According to the company’s management, such a decision was made taking into account that after the end of quarantine the company’s staff will have freedom to opt for teleworking. Currently, all employees of the company have individual laptops for work that can be used both in the office and at home. During the quarantine, each employee had the opportunity to take two monitors and other necessary equipment home, and most were offered ergonomic chairs. However, at the end of the quarantine, all additional equipment (except laptops) will have to be returned to the offices. Thus, the grant is intended to allow employees to upgrade their home space with necessary equipment or furniture and, at the end of the quarantine, to continue working comfortably both from home and in the office.The grants will reach employees already in April 2021. The employer does not specify exactly what employees should buy and where, but has made a list of offers from partners where employees can purchase hardware or office furniture at a discount.The company also plans to offer these grants for home office to company’s newcomers and/or employees who returned after a long leave. ","In Lithuania, grant applications have been filled in by more than 3,200 employees of the company (out of approximately 4,000).

In the conclusion, the government has decided to step forward with a proposal to correct the current regulation in favour of voucher-holders. The original regulation made it possible - within 180 days from the date on which the traveller withdraws from the contract for participation in a tourist event or from the date on which the tour operator terminates the contract, directly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 - to offer the traveller a voucher for the execution of the tourist event. The voucher would be valid for a year. ","The draft regulation foresees extension of validity of the voucher accepted by the tourist, from the original one year to two years. As the government argues, the new solution is supposed to be very practical, because it will allow, on the one hand, the tourist to attend the originally planned and booked event later, when it is safe to do so from a public health perspective, and on the other hand, it will allow tour operators to settle accounts with travelers without cash involved. So the aim of the draft is to secure the interests of consumers in a more efficient way without increasing the risk borne by tourist operators, who were envisaged as the main beneficiaries of the tourism voucher.

A comparison of employment trends based on the skills forecast for 2020 and the COVID-19 scenario shows that the employment impact of the pandemic across the EU is expected to be significant for at least the next two years. According to Cedefop's assessment, not all sectors of the economy will be equally affected, as the Coronavirus has 'privileged' jobs in sectors and occupations that are flexible enough to adapt to the new norms of social distancing and teleworking.The full results of the skills forecast COVID-19 scenario work, up to 2030, will be published later this year.","In the light of Cedefop's research, the situation of individual sectors varies. Over the next two years, the 'accommodation and food service' sector is the one most affected due to prolonged closure. Employment in the 'manufacturing' and 'distribution and transport' sectors - which are among the largest in terms of employment in the EU, as well as the sectors most affected - are expected to remain well below what they would have been in the absence of the pandemic.This reflects the widespread inability of these sectors to work remotely or socially distancing, which is likely to hamper their functioning. It also underlines their dependence on consumer spending, which is expected to decline in the coming years due to the accumulated debt of households during the crisis. Similarly, economic activities such as 'real estate activities', 'science and technology' and 'administration and support services' are among the sectors most affected by the crisis, which shows how the business environment has been slowed down by COVID-19 .The 'non-market services' sectors (health, public administration and education), which accounted for around 25% of employment in the EU in 2019, are among sectors where the impact on employment is expected to be the lowest compared to the pre-COVID estimate.

The WRC developed the Code as part of the commitment made in the Programme for Government to facilitate and support remote working.A public consultation and engagement with the social partners was carried out prior to finalising the Code.There is currently no formal or legal right to disconnect under Irish or European law.,"The purpose of the Code of Practice is to provide practical guidance and best practice advice to employers and employees in relation to the Right to Disconnect and their obligations under existing legislation.It includes:* The right of an employee to not have to routinely perform work outside their normal working hours.* The right not to be penalised for refusing to attend to work matters outside of normal working hours.* The duty to respect another person’s right to disconnect (e.g., by not routinely emailing or calling outside normal working hours).While the Code is not legally enforceable, the WRC has stated that “in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court or the WRC, a Code of Practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the Code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be considered in determining that question”.",Not yet known.,National government; Trade unions; Employers' organisations; Company / Companies,,No special funding required,"Responding to the launch of the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect, Irish Congress of Trade Unions general secretary Patricia King said: “Trade unions have been to the fore in highlighting that existing checks on excessive working hours have become increasingly strained by advances in communication technology, an always-on work culture and boom in remote working. Protections must keep pace with modern ways of working if workers’ hard-won rights are to be preserved.“The new Code gives guidance and best practice to organisations and workers on the right to not engage in any work-related tasks, activities or communications outside of agreed working time and not to be penalised for exercising this right. The Code is vital for safeguarding work-life balance and better enforcement of existing laws regulating hours of employment and protecting workers’ wellbeing, given the seismic changes in work practices” Ms King said.Social policy officer, Dr Laura Bambrick said: “The scope of the Code is much more than digital rights for workers to switch-off from work-related calls and emails at the end of their working day. It applies to all types of work and all types of employment, not only remote working. In this respect, the Code will be an important tool to help tackle the longstanding issue of workers regularly doing unpaid overtime.”Employer body Ibec also welcomed the Code of Practice. Ibec Director of Employer Relations, Maeve McElwee, said: “It is positive to see the Code on Right to Disconnect focussing, as it does, on best practice, rather than layering on further legislation in circumstances where the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, already provides a very effective and defined entitlement to disconnect.”Our workplaces are changing faster than ever before and are experiencing an increased rate of adoption of new workplace technologies.

The Programme for Government commits to “progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government. The Tánaiste has also stated that a living wage could be a legacy from the pandemic.He said: “The pandemic has caused us to redefine frontline or essential workers and to reconsider the value we place on their work and the reward they should get for that work.“Traditionally, when we thought of frontline or essential workers, we thought of nurses, doctors, Gardaí or firemen. Generally, people working in the public service with relatively well paid, secure and pensionable jobs. Now with think also of retail workers, drivers, security guards, transport workers and cleaners.“One of the legacies of the pandemic must be a more inclusive society that rewards work and enterprise better. That means better terms and conditions for lower paid workers. Moving to a living wage is an important part of this. Of course, in doing so we need to recognise that many businesses are closed and are now loss-making, so we must do it in way that that does not cost jobs or cause people’s working hours to be reduced. That would be counter-productive.”","The Low Pay Commission study will examine the design of a living wage in an Irish context. It will consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could progress towards a living wage.It will examine international evidence, different calculation methods and policy implications of moving to a living wage in Ireland.The Commission will complete the report in the second half of 2021 and will submit it to the Tánaiste for consideration.Terms of Reference for Living Wage Study.The report will take account of:* National and International experience of a Living Wage* A Living Wage in Ireland* Policy implications of moving to a Living Wage* Moving towards a Living Wage in Ireland",N/A,National government; Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Employers' organisations; Other social actors (e.g. NGOs),,No special funding required,"The Small Firms Association has said now is not the time to discuss putting additional costs on business.Sven Spollen-Behrens, Director of Small Firms Association said: ""Small businesses are dealing with a huge amount of anxiety and the path to reopening seems to be getting longer every day.

Ireland is currently one of a few countries in Europe that does not have a mandatory sick pay scheme.Following this consultation, the Government approved a General Scheme of the Sick Leave Bill in June 2021. Launching the Bill, the Tánaiste said: “I believe this scheme can be one of the positive legacies of the pandemic as it will apply to illness of all forms and not just those related to COVID.”“I believe this reform is part of the pandemic dividend, the more inclusive economy and fairer society we are going to build once the pandemic is over. It’s not right that people feel forced to go to work when they are sick and it’s not good for public health. I know how difficult the past year and a half has been for workers and employers alike.We are only now getting back on our feet and are not yet out of woods. By phasing this in over a four-year period, we are taking a balanced approach to plug a well acknowledged gap in our social protections while also responding to the cost concerns of small businesses in the current economic environment. The scheme is designed to be fair and affordable with the minimum complexity and administrative burden for employers.”","The statutory sick pay scheme will be phased in over a four-year period from 2022 as follows:* 2022 – 3 days paid sick leave* 2023 – 5 days paid sick leave* 2024 – 7 days paid sick leave* 2025 – 10 days paid sick leaveStatutory Sick Pay will be paid by employers at a rate of 70% of an employee’s wage, subject to a daily threshold of €110.An employee will have to obtain a medical certificate to avail of statutory sick pay, and the entitlement is subject to the employee having worked for their employer for a minimum of six months.",N/A,National government,,No special funding required,"Reacting to the new Sick Pay Bill Ibec Director of Employer Relations, Maeve McElwee said: “The phased introduction of Statutory Sick Pay, together with a service requirement for eligibility are important factors in the development of this new legislation. However, for many businesses the next 12 months will be a critical trading period and additional costs in 2021 will have a heavy impact for those still recovering from COVID-19 and Brexit impacts. This will also be a significant cost for businesses who have a sick pay scheme in place, eliminating as the Scheme proposes, waiting days and the incorporation of illness benefit in existing policies.”In its submission to the public consultation on statutory sick pay the Small Firms Association (SFA) said it was greatly concerned about the proposed introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme in the current economic circumstances which, SFA believes, would be financially irresponsible and unsustainable. Small firms are at the mercy of the COVID-19 crisis, with Government and local authorities forced to step in to save the futures of thousands of small firms and their employees through grants, loans, and job subsidies.Responding to the launch of the public consultation on plans to guarantee all workers a right to sick pay, Irish Congress of Trade Unions General Secretary Patricia King said: “It took a pandemic to expose the big failings in how we protect workers against loss of income, the lack of a legal entitlement to sick pay from an employer being one of the most glaring examples.”“Unlike workers in nearly all European countries, workers in Ireland have no legal right to sick pay. Sick pay is at the discretion of the employer to include or not in a contract of employment. As a result, up to half of the labour force, including hundreds of thousands of low-paid essential workers, don’t receive sick pay and face being financially compelled to work when unwell” she said.Ms King added: “On foot of ICTU’s work highlighting how Ireland is completely out of line with European norms in not requiring employers to provide paid sick leave, Government has committed to legislating for a new workers’ right to sick pay.”",,,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2021/June/20210609.html; https://www.ictu.ie/press/2020/11/16/ictu-encourage-people-to-have-their-say-on-sick-pa/; https://www.ictu.ie/download/pdf/ictu_submission_to_dete_sick_pay_public_consultation_dec_2020.pdf; https://www.ibec.ie/connect-and-learn/media/2021/06/09/business-acknowledges-government-announcement-on-statutory-sick-pay-scheme; https://www.sfa.ie/Sectors/SFA/SFA.nsf/vPages/News~public-consultation-on-the-introduction-of-a-statutory-sick-pay-scheme-17-12-2020?OpenDocument; https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/Legislation/Legislation-Files/Sick-Leave-Bill-2021-RIA.pdf
