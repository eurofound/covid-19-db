This was complementary to other measures (see case AT-2020-12-/229), as those two target groups would not be able to profit from the short-time working schemes.","The support is a one-off payment and does not have to be paid back. In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:* **Phase 1**: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is €500 if the net income p.a. was below €6,000 and €1,000 if it was above €6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is €33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accomodation rents) and freelance workers.* **Phase 2**: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at €2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.All applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to €6,000. In general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 December 2020. ","Info from 1 April: Around 100,000 applications for phase 1 were counted so far. The total funds for the hardship fund were increased from €1 to 2 billion.Info from 20 April: The first phase has been completed with 144,000 applications made.

As such measures required many self-employed individuals to close their businesses or restricted their ability to make a living, the scheme was introduced to bring support in line that available to employees under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.","On 26 March 2020 the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme was announced to allow certain groups of self-employed individuals to claim a taxable cash grant worth 80% of average monthly trading profits over the last three years up to a maximum of €2,820 (GBP 2,500) for three months (could be extended). The grant will be subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions but does not need to be repaid. This is intended to match the protection provided to employed individuals, thus covering this group for the first time. The scheme is run directly through Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) which contacts eligible individuals from May 2020 onwards.","Following the criticism that businesses are likely to have to wait five weeks for first payments to be made (the delay is partly to accommodate firms having to file tax returns - required to be able to claim the benefit) and that the wait may be difficult for businesses already struggling, the Government has released data as to the take-up and cost of the scheme up to the end of June 2020.3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the income and trading activity criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment returns from 2018-19 and earlier years. However, some of these businesses will not have continued trading since 2018-19 or will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus so will not be eligible.* On the 13 May, there had been 441,000 claims made, with a total value of £1.3 billion. * By the 31 May, the total number of claims was 2.5 million, with a value of £7.2 billion. * By the 30 June, the total number of SEISS claims was 2.6 million (75% of the potentially eligible population), with a value of £7.7 billion.  The average value per claim was £2,900.Around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m). A lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (70%) compared to males (78%).  The average claim for females is also lower at £2,300 compared to the average claim for males of £3,200. By 30 June, HMRC had received 1,805,000 claims from men totalling £5.7bn compared to 745,000 claims from women for £1.7bn.Around 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 75%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.  The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (60% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at £3,300. The youngest age group have the second lowest take up rate (68%) and the lowest average claim value at £2,100.The sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 30 June, construction workers had made 867,000 claims for SEISS totalling £3.1bn, an average of £3,500 per claimant.  Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 221,000 claims totalling £481m. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 193,000 claims totalling £399m.The two regions with the highest number of claims are London (484,000) and the South East (373,000), reflecting their relative sizes.",National government,One person or microenterprises,National funds,The scheme was welcomed by both the CBI and the TUC (see sources).,Other,Informed,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme; https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-gives-support-to-millions-of-self-employed-individuals; https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses; https://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/articles/cbi-response-to-new-self-employment-support/; https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/new-wage-support-measures-step-forward-self-employed-workers-says-tuc; https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891603/SEISS_Official_Statistics_June_2020.pdf; https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891603/SEISS_Official_Statistics_June_2020.pdf

The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ","The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees’ (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to 2,820 Euros (£2,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.Employers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.","The scheme has been critizised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures). The scheme is set to be up and running by the end of April 2020 with the possibility of claiming payments in arrears.By the 19 July (the latest available data), the total number of jobs furloughed was 9.5 million, with 1.2 million employers utilising the scheme, at a total cost to the government of £29.8 billion (HM Government, 2020).",National government,Employees in standard employment; Workers in non-standard forms of employment,National funds,"The introduction of the scheme was welcomed by both the TUC and CBI in press releases on 20 March 2020.However, on the 7 July, the TUC responded to the Chancellor’s announced changes to the scheme.

It states that the bonus is a better option than a ‘cliff edge end’ to the scheme, but that it won’t be sufficient to help the hardest-hit businesses, nor will it help those workers who are shielding or whose caring responsibilities mean they can’t return to their workplace. The CBI continues to be supportive and had published a guide to the furlough scheme for business.",No involvement,Informed,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-could-be-covered-by-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme; https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme; https://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/articles/cbi-responds-to-the-chancellors-latest-support-measures/; https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/wage-subsidies-package-vital-breakthrough-workers-and-economy-says-tuc; https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-coronavirus-covid-19-statistics; https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/changes-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme; https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/far-more-needed-protect-uk-against-mass-unemployment; https://www.cbi.org.uk/articles/cbi-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-factsheet/

To cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the Government, via the Prime Minister's Decree of 4 March 2020, simplified the conditions to apply the smart working regime (lavoro agile) to the workforce. The goal is to encourage companies to employ this job scheme to ensure, when possible, business continuity.","Article 1, lett. n) of the Prime Minister's Decree of 4 March 2020 authorises the adoption of the smart working regime without executing, with the employees, the individual agreement required by the law in normal conditions. This individual agreement contains, in general, significant dispositions steering the performance under the smart working regime, like the rules implementing the right to disconnect. Moreover, Article 1, lett. n) specifies that the informative obligations bearing on the employer according to Law No. 81 of 2017 can be fulfilled, while the measure is into force, through electronic communications.All the workers that can realise their performance working remotely are eligible, provided that the employer wants to activate this scheme.Law Decree No. 18 of 17 March 2020, converted into law No. 27 of 24 April 2020, further intervened on the issue of smart working: Until the end of the state of emergency, workers with disabilities or who have a person with a disability in their family unit, have the right to smart working, provided it is compatible with the characteristics of their activity.

According to the results of the survey [When working from home is smart](http://www.cgil.it/smart-working-cgil-lunedi-presentazione-indagine-con-landini-e-camusso/), several critical issues emerge in workers' experience of smart working. The former secretary of CGIL, Susanna Camusso, now responsible of gender policies in the trade union, highlighted the profound gender differences in experiencing the smart working, arguing that smart working cannot be seen as a form of work-life balance only for women, as they are more penalized and discriminated against, both on the relational and the purely professional front. Moreover, she argued that rules are needed to make it a truly smart job and not a transposition of a Fordist job within the walls of the house. Also the General Secretary of the union commented on the research arguing that in order to be a positive and satisfying experience for women and men, smart working must be organized and bargained with trade unions, and issues such as the right to disconnection and training need to be adequately addressed.

The employee will thus receive a sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency from the first day of his incapacity for work. This change was implemented by Act no. 63/2020 Coll, amending Act no. 461/2003 Coll on social insurance and Act no. 311/2001 Coll Labor Code","According to the local legal framework, in normal conditions the employee receives, during the first 10 days of incapacity to work, an income compensation directly from the employer. Only after 10 days, the employee receive a sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency. Self-employed insured persons are, then, entitled to a sick benefit for the first three days of 25% and subsequently in the amount of 55% of the assessment base.On the basis of the new COVID-19 related measure, the employer will not pay wage compensation in the case of employee's illness or if it is quarantined in reason of the epidemic, during the first 10 days of sick leave. Indeed, it will be paid by the Social Insurance Agency.Self-employed as well receives full sickness benefit from the Social Insurance Agency from the first day of sick leave (i.e. not 25% during the first three days).This measure is proposed in an effort to relieve the undertakings in times of crisis of costs related to temporary incapacity for work, as well as to increase the income of insured persons in cases of ordered quarantine measures and isolation.","As far as the costs of the Social Insurance Agency are concerned, they are estimated that 100,000 sickness benefits will be paid out in 2020. Beyond the current legal status, the sickness benefits will be paid to the persons concerned from the Social Insurance Agency for ten calendar days. The average assessment base of the person concerned is assumed to be at the level of the average wage of 2019, i.e. €1,092, as sickness benefits are basically based on the previous year's income. Expenditure on the basis of these assumptions is expected to be around €19.4 million in 2020.The employers concerned are expected to achieve savings on compensation for temporary incapacity for work of about €169.4 on average per employee in quarantine measures, which is around € 16.9 million for the entire business sector (about 100,000 employees). Exact data on the total savings of employers are not available, because the Social Insurance Agency does not record data on the paid wage compensation or its amount (these data are not relevant for the performance of social insurance).",National government; Company / Companies; Social insurance,Employees in standard employment; Self-employed,National funds,Not available. ,No involvement,No involvement,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2020/63/

It also supports projects aimed at maintaining employees in employment in connection with the declaration of an emergency like the ones concerning the COVID-19 epidemic.

The basic conditions for providing the allowance are that: * the employer/self-employed pays to the employee a wage compensation in the amount of 80% of his average earnings; *  the employer/self-employed does not initiate termination of employment by notice or agreement; *  that on 31 December 2019 the company was not in difficulties. The contribution is not intended for self-employed themselves, but is limited to self-employed people who have hired one or more employees. The amount of the allowance for one employee corresponds to the compensation of the employee's salary in the amount of 80% of his average earnings, up to a maximum of € 1,100.

Indeed, as a consequence of the restrictions and the social distancing measures introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, jobseekers are increasingly at risk of not finding a job for a longer period of time. Therefore, the Parliament decided that during the pandemic unemployment benefit should be paid for a longer period.","During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the unemployment benefit period has been extended by one month (up to a maximum of seven months) for those who could not find a job.

During this period of quarantine, one parent must remain with the children. So far, the nursing benefit has been paid only for 10 calendar days. The Act. 63/2020 Coll. extends the period of payment of this benefit to the whole period of closure of a school or pre-school facility.","According to this COVID-19 related measure, the entitlement to the nursing benefit arises from the first day of the need for personal and full-time treatment of a close person and only expires on the day the need for his/her personal and full-day treatment ends (and not as previously, for a maximum of 10 days). The condition of receiving the nursing benefit is that the beneficiary treats a child under 16 years of age all day, whose health condition, as confirmed by the relevant doctor, necessarily requires treatment by another natural person. The benefit is also paid if the beneficiary cares for the child until the age of eleven (up to 18 years of age with long-term adverse health conditions), when the child has been ordered to quarantine or isolate. The benefit shall also be paid if the pre-school or social care facility in which the child is being provided, or the school the child attends, has been closed by decision of the competent authorities or has been subject to a quarantine measure.

Due to the nature of the Croatian tourism where majority of the guests are coming by private booking with personal cars during the summer season in June and August, it is possible to achieve relatively decent results if the pandemic will last one month. However, if the coronavirus will last for two months or more, there could be really harmful consequences for the Croatian tourism and the economy in total. It should be relatively easy to solve the economic consequences of a short duration of the disease. On the other hand, a longer duration of the pandemic situation in Croatia and in Italy, which is one of Croatian most important foreign trade partner and whose citizens traditionally present a significant part of overseas tourists in Croatia, could have seriously adverse outcomes for the Croatian economic growth. This measure is not exclusively related to tourism industry, but one can assess that this industry has been seriously negatively impacted by the crisis.  ","The support for preservation of jobs in sectors affected by coronavirus is implemented by the Croatian Employment Service by awarding grants as a form of co-financing of wage costs. The Croatian Employment Service (CES) awards grants to an eligible employer in the amount of HRK 3.250,00 (€434) per month for full-time worker and HRK 1.625,00 (€217) per month for part-time worker. CES also awards a proportional part of the amount of HRK 3,250.00 or HRK 1,625.00 per worker for the time they did not work according to the decision of the Civil Protection Directorate. The support can be provided to * employers in the following activities: providing accommodation and preparation and serving of food and drinks (Sector I), transportation and storage (Sector H) and health tourism; labour-intensive activities within the manufacturing industry like textiles, clothing, footwear, leather, wood and furniture; * employers who have been banned from performing their business activities by decisions of the Civil Protection Headquarters (national, county, local self-government units) and cannot carry out their activities, and * all other employers who can prove the adverse impact of special circumstances, if their income is reduced by more than 20%. Since 26 March 2020 all beneficiaries of grants for self-employment (owners and employees), employers who have been registered at the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute by 29 February 2020 and all workers employed until 29 February 2020 have also been included. The support cannot be granted if there has been a decrease in the number of employees in the period from 20 March 2020 until the date of submission of the Grant Application, if the percentage of dismissal is greater than: * 40% for employers employing up to 10 workers; * 20% for small businesses;* 15%for medium-sized enterprises and * 10% for large companies. The aforementioned amount of the grant - HRK 3,250 or HRK 1,625 per worker - is applied for March 2020, while for April and May 2020 it will be increased per worker monthly to HRK 4,000 (€534) for full-time job or HRK 2,625 (€267) for part-time job. The state will also cover also payment of social contributions, which amounts to HRK 1,460 (€194) for a net wage of HRK 4,000. In total, the state will pay HRK 5,460 (€728) per employee.  ","At the end of March,  around 65,000 employers with around 400,000 thousand workers were registered as users of the scheme at the CES.  At the end of April, the government has paid more than one and a half billion HRK (EURO 200 million) to preserve jobs for around 485,000 employees. Almost 84,000 employers have received support, including 145 large entrepreneurs.The main criterion for assistance was a 20 percent drop in turnover. Leading recipients of the grants are big touristic company Valamar Riviera with more than 2,500 employees who have been paid more than eight million HRK (EURO 1.07 million) followed by Boxmark Leather with more than 2,000 employees, Mlinar with 1,737 employees, a car parts manufacturer from Solin AD Plastik with more than 1,500 employees. Of all beneficiaries of the grant 91,78% are micro firms with less than 10 employees, 6,99% are SME with less than 50 employees, 1.06% are medium employers with less than 250 employees, 0.03% are bigger employers with more than 250 employees.  According to the data of the Ministry of Labour and Pension System issued in May, the measures included about 550,000 employees. According to the same source, in March and April 2020 alone, the state allocated a total of around HRK 3.5 billion (€467 million) to measures to preserve jobs in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It is estimated that the measures in May 2020 costed the state treasury about HRK two billion (€267 million). Therefore, the state has spent around HRK 5.5 billion (€734 million) in three months of implementing measures to preserve employment in the coronary crisis.",National government; Public employment service,Employees in standard employment,National funds,Trade Unions demanded that the recipients of the aid should be publicly disclosed because they fear that abuse of the obtained funds is quite possible.

During the deferment period, individual borrowers will be fully relieved of debt service obligations whereas corporate borrowers will continue to pay interest and fees but enjoy a holiday on scheduled principal instalments for the duration of the deferment. However, before this act was approved, many banks have introduced their own conditions under which the borrower can ask for the postponement of repayments. Now, the new law unifies these conditions.","Eligible are all borrowers who were negatively affected by coronavirus pandemic. Applicants have to ask for the payment postponement at the bank and declare that their situation is caused by anti-virus measures (unemployment, quarantine, decrease in business activity).

However, in Croatia it is difficult to evaluate if subsidies and transfers have achieved these objectives. State subsidies in Croatia are relatively high. They have been concentrated in a few sectors, with a high proportion of them going to the national railway company Hrvatske željeznice ((HŽ) and to the agriculture sector. Due to the EU requirement and membership, Croatia has improved policies related to state subsidies and lowered their level. ","Amendments to the Act on Personal Income Tax and Amendments to the Act on the Company Income Tax (OG 32/20) introduced novelties regarding the impact of grants on the income tax base and tax liability for entrepreneurs which received grants intended to mitigate the adverse effects of special circumstances. Income tax payers record grants into realized income, but exclude it from the tax base when determining the income tax liability. According to the amended Act on Company Income Tax, grants obtained due to special circumstances do not affect the threshold for compulsory shift from personal income tax to company income tax. This threshold is HRK 7.5 million (€ 1 million) of revenue. Furthermore, grants obtained do not affect the threshold of realized annual revenues according to which the tax rate of 12% and 18% is determined (the threshold is HRK 7.5 million (€ 1 million) of revenue.It is hard to predict the role of this measure and the number of possible users but from the public discussions it can be assessed that it would be relatively limited.

On March 31, the government supported the proposal of the Ministry of Culture and expanded the normative regulation also to self-employed and the micro-entrepreneurs.  The allowance for idle time measure in general is described in Section 14 of the law 'On Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Threat to the State and Its Consequences Due to the Spread of COVID-19' (adopted on 20 March 2020, valid from 22 March 2020).Specifically regarding the self-employed, the government has adopted the Regulations of Cabinet of Ministers No. 179, 'Regulations regarding the Allowance for Idle Time for self-employed who are affected by spread of COVID-19' (Adopted on 31 March 2020).","The eligible self-employed are individuals registered in the State Revenue Service as involved in economic activity, that have paid social contributions as self-employed, or as receiver of author’s fee, or have paid micro-enterprise tax, or have paid taxes as individual merchants, and have not got income during the idle period, except some permanent authors’ fees.The allowance is calculated using the State Revenue Service data that is provided in the declarations of self-employed, according to the following criteria:* For those who pay micro-enterprise tax, 50% of average monthly income from the economic activity as micro-entrepreneur (reference period is last two full quarters).* Self-employed person in general tax regime – 75% of the average income (the reference period is the two last full quarters, income is calculated in accordance with the state mandatory social insurance contribution of a person).* For a person from both above mentioned categories who within the idle time has returned to work after child care leave – 100% of granted parents benefit (the reference period is of six months before declaring the state of emergency).For neither of categories the allowance can be more than €700.The regulations define 17 reasons when the allowance can be rejected. ","For the period from 12 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 the State Revenue Service (SRS) has paid idle-time allowances to 2,388 self-employed persons.

These measures mainly concern: flexibilization of the working time, working from home, teleworking.Soon after this, on the 16 March 2020, the Romanian President has declared a state of emergency – as a result, schools  remained closed until Orthodox Easter (19 April) initially. After 30 days, the state of emergency was prolonged with another 30 days, till 15 May 2020 - during all this period, the schools remain suspended. This situation left a lot of employees without any immediate solutions to ensure their children supervision and care. To  respond to this problem, the Romanian Parliament passed a law (Law no. 19/2020) requiring employers (both in the public and the private sector) to grant paid leave to one of the parents if schools are closed due to “extreme situations”. ","According to the law 19/2020 , employers must grant employees paid leave if schools are closed in exceptional circumstances, but only if the tasks associated with the employees’ roles cannot be performed in “working from home” or teleworking conditions. Paid leave can be granted to only one of the parents, and only if the child in care is of maximum 12 years of age (or 18 years of age for children with a disability), who are formally registered as attending courses in a school. In some sectors, the parent's request for leave is conditioned by the employer's acceptance (national energy system units, operating units in the nuclear sectors, continuous fire units, health and social care units, telecommunications, public radio and television, rail transport, units that ensure the public transport and sanitation of the localities, as well as the supply of the population with gas, electricity, heat, and water). During such leave, employees will be entitled to a payment of up to 75% of the employee’s base salary, but not more than 75% of the average gross salary in the economy. The allowance is subject to personal income tax and social security contributions (i.e. personal income tax, social security contribution, health insurance contribution and work insurance contribution). The net value of the allowance paid by the employer (the amount actually received by the parent) can be recovered from the Guarantee Fund for the payment of salary claims; the corresponding personal income tax and the social security contributions are borne by the employer. To recover the net allowance, employers should submit a request to the local or the Bucharest unemployment agency. ",These applies to all employees with children in care. There is no estimation yet regarding the number of parents/employers that made use of the legal provision. ,National government; Trade unions; Employers' organisations; Company / Companies,Parents,Companies; National funds,The social partners have been consulted during the legislative process in the Romanian Parliament (specialized committees discussions). ,Direct consultation,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,"http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/223814; https://lege5.ro/Gratuit/gm3dkmjvgu4a/ordonanta-de-urgenta-nr-30-2020-pentru-modificarea-si-completarea-unor-acte-normative-precum-si-pentru-stabilirea-unor-masuri-in-domeniul-protectiei-sociale-in-contextul-situatiei-epidemiologice-deter; http://www.mmuncii.ro/j33/index.php/ro/comunicare/comunicate-de-presa/5827-recomand%C4%83rile-ministerului-muncii-%C8%99i-protec%C8%9Biei-sociale-%C3%AEn-scopul-prevenirii-r%C4%83sp%C3%A2ndirii-infect%C4%83rii-cu-coronavirus; http://www.mmuncii.ro/j33/index.php/en/press-room/5829-recommendations-of-the-mlsp-to-prevent-the-spread-of-coronavirus-infection,-march-10,-2020"

In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government adopted a ‘temporary lay-off scheme’ and reimbursement of wage compensations to workers who cannot work due to force majeure. The measure addresses laid-off workers for whom company temporary fails to provide work and workers who cannot work due to force majeure: * workers in quarantine, who cannot work from home; * workers who look after children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; * workers who cannot come to work on the grounds of the suspension of public transport or ban on the border crossing.","According to the Employment Relationship Act, when a company temporarily fails to provide work for business reasons (in the event of a temporary layoff), the worker is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of 80% of the wage basis. The wage basis is determined at the worker’s average monthly wage for full-time work during the past three months. On the other hand, if a worker cannot carry out his work due to force majeure, he is entitled to half of the payment he would have received if he was working, but not less than 70% of the minimum wage. The temporary laid-off worker is obliged to respond to the employer’s invitation in a manner and under the conditions laid down in the lay-off letter (Employment Relationship Act, Articles 137, 138). The measure being examined, attempting to cushion the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, grants the employers with 80% reimbursement of the sums payed to provide the economic treatment mentioned above to workers (in case of temporary lay-off as well as force majeure). This reimbursement is funded with the state budget. Reimbursement is limited to the average monthly salary in 2019 and cannot be lower than the minimum wage (it is thus higher than statutory determined compensations). The maximum length of receiving compensation is from 13 March to 31 May.To be eligible for the reimbursements, a company had to demonstrate a 20% lower income in the first half of 2020 and 50% lower income in the second half of 2020, compared to 2019.","Companies that are not eligible are: * State institutions. * Financial and insurance companies with more than 10 employees. * Companies having outstanding debt with the Financial Administration. * Foreign or international organisations (not including humanitarian and disability organisations).The Employment Service of Slovenia administers employers’ requests for compensations. Up to 31 May, the Employment Service received requests for wage compensation for 275,317 employees and additional 54,168 since 1 June.In first reactions, employers protested against the rule requesting 20% lower incomes. They said that it would exclude many companies from the support mechanism (Mekina, 2020). The government agreed to employer organisations and lowered the threshold to 10% in the second COVID-19 law ZIUZEOP-A, issued on 30 April 2020. ",National government; Social insurance,,National funds,"Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted many proposals to the law, mainly for clarifying the definitions. More importantly, employer organizations proposed the withdrawal of the rule of 20% lower income linked to company revenues. They argued that state support shouldn’t stimulate companies to work less. Trade unions demanded a fixed period of six months after the epidemic in which employers shouldn’t lay off workers for business reasons. Some proposals were accepted but not these two. The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. It was blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council.While employer organisations achieved a lower threshold (reduction of company income by 10% compared to the pre-crisis level in the second COVID-19 law ZIUZEOP-A, issued on 30 April 2020), trade unions were less successful.

Deferred payment must be paid in two years, until 31 March 2022, in one installment with no interest charge. It is an automatically recognized right meaning that there is no need to submit any claim for obtaining this right. Eligible are self-employed persons (including farmers) who do not employ other workers.The  first and second COVID-19 laws (ZIUZEOP and ZIUZEOP-A) have introduced the right of self-employed persons to be fully exempt from paying social security contributions. Eligible persons are self-employed, clerics, associates, and farmers who cannot carry out their work. They have to make a request to Financial Administration in which they prove 10% lower income in 2020 compared to 2019 or, in cases of recently established businesses, 10% lower average monthly income compared to the pre-crisis level. Later on, beneficiaries will have to pay social security contributions if their revenue exceeds 90% of the revenue in the pre-crisis period. Tee Financial administration manages the requests for exemption from paying social security contributions. Postponed and annulled payments of social security contributions are limited to the period between 13 March and 31 May 2020. After 31 May no new claims will be accepted. In addition to these two measures, self-employed may also claim for deferred payment of income tax.","While the COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP, issued on 10 April 2020) was in parliamentary procedure, non-governmental organizations protested against discriminatory “referential period” for self-employed persons. While referential period for companies was one year, it was one month (February) for self-employed. The argument was that this rule exclude many self-employed persons, as they typically receive their fees irregularly and many may have had no money inflows in February. Their proposal was not integrated into the first COVID-19 law, issued on 10 April 2020.Two cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stressed that the emergency measure left out the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed (Šučur, 2020).The second COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP-A from 30 April 2020) finally adopted their proposals: it extended the referential period as well as the group of eligible persons (besides full-time also part-time self-employed).",National government; Social insurance,Self-employed,National funds,Trade unions and employer organizations have submitted proposals to the law but no one linked to this measure.,Other,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO819; http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO818; https://www.gov.si/novice/2020-04-03-ukrepi-na-davcnem-podrocju-za-blazitev-posledic-koronavirusa-za-samozaposlene; https://www.dnevnik.si/1042926927/Kultura/pomoc-samozaposlenim-v-kulturi-na-cigavi-strani-je-ministrstv; https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-0901?sop=2020-01-090

The government is expected to follow this advice.","For meal, eco and gift vouchers, which expire in March, April, May and June 2020, it is necessary that an immediate extension of 6 months is provided from the date of expiry of such vouchers. For the sports/culture vouchers: request to postpone the expiry date of the sports/culture vouchers from 30 September to 31 December 2020.There is no limit per person to the amount of cheques that can be be extended.

Foreign workers or seasonal workers employed in Austria are no longer allowed to enter the country, resulting in a shortage of labour both on farms and in food processing companies (e.g. meat sector). In order to ensure and maintain the food supply, all the work that is now necessary must be carried out on time. The Chambers of Agriculture, together with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and the machinery ring, are endeavouring to support farmers and processing enterprises in carrying out the necessary work on schedule despite the current situation and thus to continue to ensure the supply of domestic food. ","Farmers can register their demand for urgently needed labour via an online platform; interested workers can register likewise. They are paid according to collective agreements, but also voluntary (i.e. unpaid) work is possible. Also persons on short-time work in their regular job may apply (they are allowed to have additional earnings with no upper limit). Students of certain relevant schools or university programmes can have this work credited as internships. Placement is made according to the urgency of the work to be carried out in the companies, including seasonal work. In order to be able to find the right workers for the companies, general conditions such as the type of work, the amount of work and time frame, as well as the required duration of the work on the company etc. are checked and compared with the data of the interested helpers.","Initially, the offer has exceeded the demand by far, but farmers are not entirely content with this initiative.

(The so-called 'alternative civilian service' is an alternative form of the mandatory national military service (substitute service).

It is planned to transfer civilian servicemen who are currently serving or will soon be serving to positions where there is special need (e.g. if a civilian servant would have an assignment for a kindergarten, but this is closed, he will be assigned to another facility instead, e.g. a retirement home). In addition, former civil servants are recruited voluntarily for full-time positions (at least 40 hours per week, overtime can be added) from May or June 2020 for a duration of two to three months.While regular civil servants who have been mandatorily extended receive their regular remuneration (€346.70) plus supplement of  €189.90 (tax free), the newly recruited voluntary former civil servants receive in addition to this a flat-rate compensation of almost €1,300 (gross).

Teleworking is a right provided for in Article L. 1222-9 of the Labour Code, resulting from the Order of 22 September 2017, and must be favoured in phase 3 of the epidemic. An employee can therefore ask his employer to benefit from telework until further notice. The employer may refuse, but reasons must be given for the refusal.","Since the passage to stage 3 of the epidemic, the implementation of telework must be imperative as soon as the workstation allows it. Telework can be implemented when the workstation layout is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity and to guarantee the protection of employees.Article L. 1222-11 of the Labour Code mentions the risk of an epidemic as a possible justification for the use of telework without the employee's agreement. The implementation of telework in this context does not require any particular formalism.In a circular, the ministry of Labour estimate the employee must receive an allowance intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework: 'In the context of the current health crisis – since telework is carried out, in the majority of cases, over the entire actual working time and is made necessary to allow the continuity of the company's activity, to guarantee the protection of employees and for reasons of public health – it should be considered that the employer is obliged to pay his employee a telework allowance, intended to reimburse the employee for the costs arising from telework'. Indeed, the employer has an obligation to bear the professional expenses. This obligation is provided for without restriction by the case-law, which is of general application and must cover teleworkers.'However, adds the ministry of Labour, in view of the difficulty of identifying and circumscribing the expenses relating to the professional activity and those relating to personal life, it is in the employer's interest to favour a lump sum which will simplify its management'.If the allowance paid by the employer is a lump sum, it will then be deemed to be used in accordance with its purpose and will be exempt from social security contributions up to an overall limit of €10/month for an employee who teleworks one day per week. This exempt lump-sum allowance increases to €20/month for an employee teleworking two days a week, €30/month for 3 days a week, etc.","In 2017, about 3.0% of employees were teleworking at least once a week.

The measure aims at protecting companies from bankruptcies due to negative consequences of the epidemic. The management can abstain from the duty to start the compulsory settlement or bankruptcy until 31 August if the company became insolvent because of the epidemic. When a creditor files for a bankruptcy proceeding over a debtor, the debtor will have 4 months instead of current 2 months for financial restructuring to prevent bankruptcy. Extensions will be applicable to bankruptcy proceedings, filed for by creditors until 31 August 2020. Other changes tackle compensation of unpaid wages from the Guarantee Fund, personal bankruptcy procedures, and enforcement proceedings.","Deferred compulsory settlement or bankruptcy means that management is not obliged to start this procedure during the period of epidemic and the three succeeding months (until 31 August). The management can abstain from the duty if the company becomes insolvent due to the state, ministry or local authority’s ban on production or trade or if company was solvent on 31 December 2020. On the other hand, the law reinforces some workers’ rights. Workers can have easier access to reimbursements of the Public Scholarship, Development, Disability and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (Guarantee Fund) for unpaid wages in the last three months, unpaid sick leave, annual leave and severance payment. Employees are entitled to compensation from the Guarantee Fund if they filed for a bankruptcy proceeding. This rule is valid until 30 June 2020. From July 2020, workers again needs court’s final decision in a bankruptcy proceeding to get access to the Guarantee Fund. Employees may have also easier access to the Guarantee Fund if they have not received wage compensations one month from the time the state paid reimbursements to their employers. In these cases, the employer is presumed no longer solvent (presumption is valid until September 2020) and employees may file for a bankruptcy proceeding. If they do so, they are exempt from paying the advance for costs of a bankruptcy proceeding. As for personal bankruptcy and enforcement, the law stipulates that payments under emergency laws are not the object of personal bankruptcy and enforcement. Exceptions are made for wage compensation. Finally, during the COVID-19 epidemic the enforcement proceedings are temporarily suspended. Exemptions are enforcement based on a claim for legal alimony and other urgent matters, determined by the court.","Emergency regulation on insolvency curbs the risks of bankruptcies on the one hand, while protects the interests of workers on the other.

It is thus covered by a limited set of labour rights, like the ban on discrimination and harassment, the interdiction of child work, rules on working time, breaks, and rest periods, the prohibition of work for some specific groups. The Agricultural Act explicitly mentions viticulture, fruit growing, hop growing, and vegetable growing as sectors much in need of such unprotected and occasional labour force.The 2020 provisions lifting restrictions to the utilization of temporary work in agriculture have been introduced to put a remedy to the shortage of immigrant workers in the agricultural sector, due to the limitations to cross-border movements caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. ","The measure responds to the concern of some agricultural sectors which, after the ban on border crossing relating to the COVID-19 epidemic, remained without seasonal migrant workers. By rule, ‘temporary work in agriculture’ is limited to 120 days a year. The emergency regulation suspend this limitation until the end of 2020.

Financial support should be equal to real damage, but cannot exceed 80% of the minimum wage.Emergency regulation endows agricultural businesses with the right to financial compensation for the loss of income during the epidemic. The loss of income means the inability of selling supply or lower scale of production if it causes a decrease in revenue by 20%. Agricultural businesses may claim for financial support for the time of epidemic as well as for three succeeding months. The calculation of compensation will be based on a flat rate taking into consideration the number of hectares or livestock units or average catch in the last three years.

The new amendment gives a legal right to an unemployed person to receive unemployment benefits from the state and at the same time work at a rural stop and take a salary from there.According to unofficial information, the Ministry of Agriculture is also discussing the possibility of workers in enterprises that have been introduced to reduced working hours due to the coronavirus crisis and are being compensated under the 60/40 scheme, to be able to start additional work in agriculture.","People receiving unemployment or social assistance benefits can earn additional income from seasonal work in agriculture without losing their entitlement to state support. Those who are currently on unpaid leave can also sign a second employment contract without permission from their primary employer.

The key change in this case is that the conclusion of such contracts would not affect the receipt of unemployment benefits or social benefits by employees, which in previous years was a serious obstacle to securing seasonal workers on the field.Currently, there is also no limit to the length of time that employees can work under the second employment contract while on unpaid leave.

However, this scheme has been modified to take into account the COVID-19 crisis to support purchase power of employees working during the crisis in essential services and all other companies that have stayed open.","According to an ordinance dated 1 April 2020 published in the context of the health crisis, the exceptional purchasing power bonus, that is exempted of social contribution and tax-free, can reach €2,000 for companies that have set up a profit-sharing agreement. Those that do not have one can nevertheless pay the exceptional bonus, but within the limit of €1,000. On the basis of the Article 11 of the emergency law of 23 March 2020 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, an ordinance published on 2 April 2020 relaxes the conditions for payment of the exceptional purchasing power bonus provided for in Article 7 of the law on the financing of social security for 2020 (LFSS 2020). The aim is to encourage companies to make use of this scheme in the context of the epidemic, bearing in mind that the premium can now be paid until 31 August 2020 (instead of 30 June).Companies that do not have a profit-sharing agreement ('accord d'intéressement') can use the bonus by benefiting from these exemptions, if the amount paid does not exceed €1,000. Until now, these companies have been excluded from the measure.For companies which implement a profit-sharing agreement on the date of payment of the bonus, the maximum amount exempted is €2,000 (instead of €1,000 up to now). The profit-sharing agreement may be for a period of between one and three years if it was concluded between 1 January and 31 August 2020, with the deadline of 30 June 2020 being extended. Initially, the exceptional purchase power bonus scheme allowed its amount to be modulated between employees according to remuneration, classification level, length of actual presence during the year or the working time provided for in the employment contract. The ordinance provides for a new possibility of modulation, depending on 'working conditions related to the Covid-19 epidemic'. According to the Ministry of Labour, this new possibility was intended in particular to give companies the possibility of rewarding more people who, for example, are forced to go to their workplace than those who are not obliged to do so","So far, only 37,000 companies have paid a bonus in 2020. The Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire call to reward employees 'who had the courage to go to their workplace' despite the health crisis.Particularly targeted, large retailers seems to have received the message: Auchan, Carrefour, Intermarché, Lidl, Système U and Leclerc have already announced that their employees would receive a bonus of €1,000. The same goes for the 15,000 Veolia employees who remained in the field to manage water and waste, or for 5,000 employees of the Total group.It should be noted that some companies have not yet made their decision, waiting in particular to assess the effects of the crisis on their cash flow: they now have until August 31 to do so (compared to June 30 initially).",Trade unions; Company / Companies,Companies providing essential services,No special funding required,"To provide a bonus over €1,000 exempted of social contribution and taxes, the employer have to reach an agreement with the representative trade unions, or if there are no trade union, with the works council, or if there is no works council, after a vote of the employee.",Direct consultation,Negotiated,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041746313; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041776879

The CEA points out that despite the best intentions and quick reaction of the adoption of this measure, there are numerous omissions that endanger the business of the entrepreneurs and they cannot be tolerated. The biggest problem appeared in the application methodology itself, because it remained unclear whether entrepreneurs can apply only through the Financial Agency (FINA) portal or they have to do it directly through HAMAG-BICRO. Due to these ambiguities, some entrepreneurs have inacceptable applications, although not through their own fault. The COVID-19 variable capital loan was one of the very important measures to help the economy, but it did not yield the expected results. At the beginning of July two months have passed since closing of the tender, and thousands of entrepreneurs who had applied have yet obtain the results whether they will get a loan or not. If a variable capital loan is allowed, then the process needs to be fast in order to immediately affect the liquidity of the company. Otherwise, in a few months, the company may no longer exist.

Over 60% of holders of family agricultural holdings are over 55 and less than 4 % under 35. The economic crisis and the previous wartime events have contributed to migratory movements from rural to urban areas, particularly of the younger population, resulting in a general decline in the rural population and an increase in the ageing population. This poses a serious threat to the further development and even survival of the rural areas themselves. Young people are a key resource for the development of a modern and competitive agricultural sector, primarily because of their willingness and ability to adapt easily to technological changes, new practices and changing market conditions which is a requirement to increase productivity and competitiveness. Some achieved progress has come under the question due to the recent crisis.","The target groups of financial instruments Micro loans for rural development are primarily small business entities in the agricultural, processing and forestry sectors. Loans can be obtained in the amount of € 1,000 to €25,000 and the funds are provided from the Rural Development Program. The repayment period is up to three years with an interest rate of 0.5 percent and a grace period of up to 12 months. The measure offers the possibility of settling bills created up to three months before the loan application is received, with significantly less documentation and a prepared Business Plan form. The Business Plan form is quite simple with pages on two-page questions, which significantly shortens the time of preparation of the application and enables easier and faster processing. Due to restricted movement of possible beneficiaries and with the desire to simplify the procedure, the Croatian Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments (HAMAG-BICRO) recommends on-line applications. The used of these loans can be an important step in improving the economic performance of farms and facilitating farm restructuring and modernization, notably with a view to increasing market participation and orientation. Furthermore, such financial sources can be of crucial importance to needed agricultural diversification. ","The number of possible applicants and available resources are currently unknown. However, due to serious problems in the observed sector it can be estimated that the interest for this type of financing will be significant.

Loans were initially due to be worth up to GBP1.2m to support SMEs. On 17 March, this was increased to GPB5 million. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan. The Government has also said the first 12 months of the loan would be offered interest free, with Government meeting the cost of those interest payments. Initially, the interest free period was due to last 6 months.  The scheme went live on 23 March 2020.The background regulation is the Coronavirus Act 2020, emergency legislation which received Royal Assent on the 25 March after having been fast-tracked through Parliament in just four days.","This temporary scheme aims to allow small and medium businesses across the UK with an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million, which are experiencing lost or deferred revenues to access loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance of up to £5 million for up to 6 years.The government will also make a Business Interruption Payment to cover the first 12 months of interest payments and any lender-levied fees. This means smaller businesses will benefit from no upfront costs and lower initial repayments.The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to pre-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs.The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank. There are 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks, as well as challenger banks, asset-based lenders and smaller specialist local lenders.  A business is eligible if:* it is based in the UK* has an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million* has a borrowing proposal which the lender would consider viable, if not for the coronavirus pandemic. To access the scheme, businesses should approach their own provider – ideally via the lender’s website. They may also consider approaching other lenders if they are unable to access the finance they need.  Decision-making on eligibility for CBILS is fully delegated to the accredited CBILS lenders. On 25 March, the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority together wrote to Britain’s banking sector with a warning not to allow fundamentally viable companies to collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.Finance terms are up to six years for term loans and asset finance facilities. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years. The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt.At the discretion of the lender, the scheme may be used for unsecured lending for facilities of GBP 250,000 and under. Initially, the eligibility criteria stated that for facilities above GBP 250,000, the lender must establish a lack or absence of security prior to businesses using CBILS. It also stated that if the lender could offer finance on normal commercial terms without the need to make use of the scheme, they should do so. However, these were changed as the scheme progressed. Thus, on the 2 April 2020, the Government made changes to the scheme, namely:* No personal guarantees for facilities under GBP 250k: Personal guarantees of any form cannot be taken under the scheme for any facilities below GBP 250k.* Personal guarantees for facilities above GBP 250k: Personal guarantees may still be required, at a lender’s discretion, but recoveries under these are capped at a maximum of 20% of the outstanding balance of the CBILS facility after the proceeds of business assets have been applied. A Principal Private Residence (PPR) cannot be taken as security to support a personal guarantee or as security for a CBIL backed facility.* Security: For all facilities, including those over GBP 250,000, CBILS can now support lending to smaller businesses even where a lender considers there to be sufficient security, making more smaller businesses eligible to receive the business interruption payment.The Government announced that these changes should be retrospectively applied by lenders for any CBILS facilities offered since 23 March 2020. For any commercial (non-CBILS) facilities offered since the same date, providing the borrower meets the CBILS eligibility criteria, lenders have been asked to bring these facilities onto CBILS wherever possible (e.g. where the lender is accredited to offer the same facility through CBILS) and changes retrospectively applied as necessary.","By the 19 July (the latest available data), the CBILS had received a total of 112,212 applications (this figure includes approved applications, applications that are still to be processed, applications that have been declined or turn out not to be eligible as well as withdrawn applications, where borrowers decide not to proceed). This number also includes a number of applications that have subsequently been converted to applications for the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS scheme) - see the [specific case for this new initiative](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/GB-2020-19/944). The number of facilities/loans approved by the 19 July was 55,674 with a value of £12.20bn (HM Treasury, 2020).",National government,SMEs,National funds,"Assume that there was discussion/consultation with the small business associations, There was discussion with the banking and finance industry.",Unknown,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme; https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents; https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-treasury-coronavirus-covid-19-business-loan-scheme-statistics

GB-2020-12/524,Reclaiming of statutory sick pay by SMEs,Reclaiming of Statutory Sick Pay by SMEs,United Kingdom,Applies nationwide,03/17/2020,,Open ended,Legislations or other statutory regulations,New aspects included into existing measure,Income protection beyond short-time work,Paid sick leave,04/13/2020,"As it is anticipated that many employees will be off sick with the virus (the Government states that in a worst case scenario, a fifth of all employees will be absent from work) and that a large proportion of these who work in SMEs will only have statutory entitlement, this measure allows eligible firms to claim back the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) they disburse to such employees.The legal reference is the emergency legislation, the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 39 is the relevant regulation (which amends The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992); this section gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.","In Budget 2020, the UK Government announced that Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be met in full for up to 14 days per employee. The Chancellor estimates that this will cost up to £2 billion and help up to 2 million businesses. In its factsheet on government support for those affected by Covid-19, HM Treasury said that the eligibility criteria for the scheme would be as follows:* this refund will cover up to 2 weeks’ SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19;* employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible; the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020;* employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19;* employers should maintain records of staff absences, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note;* eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of Statutory Sick Pay to self-isolators comes into force;• the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible. Existing systems are not designed to facilitate employer refunds for SSP47.SSP is the minimum that employers have to pay out to qualifying sick employees. It is currently paid at GBP 94.25 per week (GBP 95.85 from 6 April 2020) and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. In order to qualify for SSP, an employee’s average weekly earnings must be above GBP 118 (GBP 120 from 6 April 2020). Some employers may pay enhanced sick pay over and above the SSP rate. This would be detailed in an employment contract. The self-employed are not eligible for SSP. The Statutory Sick Pay (General) (Coronavirus Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/287) came into force on 13 March 2020. These Regulations (as amended) make it clear in law that employees are entitled to SSP if they are unable to work because they are self-isolating as a result of them or someone in their household showing symptoms of coronavirus.  Normally, SSP is paid from the fourth day of absence. However, on the 28 March, the Government made the Statutory Sick Pay (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Waiting Days and General Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/374). These provide that SSP is payable from the first day of absence where a worker is self-isolating because they or someone in their household has shown symptoms of coronavirus. The Regulations have retrospective from 13 March 2020.Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.The guidance says that employers will be covered in the following circumstances: If employers are: * claiming for an employee who’s eligible for sick pay due to coronavirus* had a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started on or before 28 February 2020* had fewer than 250 employees on 28 February 2020.The scheme covers all types of employment contracts, including:* full-time employees* part-time employees* employees on agency contracts* employees on flexible or zero-hour contracts.","Uptake currently unknown as there is no data available at this stage. It will apply to those employees working in organisations employing 250 or under, who are away from work due to coronavirus. This also applies if such employees are self-isolating due to a member of their household being unwell with the virus.

The new rules, which modified the calculations of the duration of compensation and the reference daily wage used to determine the amount of the back-to-work allowance, are therefore postponed to an entry into force on 1 September 2020.

This additional compensation will not reduce any future entitlements.The extension is automatic on the part of public employment service (Pôle Emploi) and is effective for payments since the beginning of April. Jobseekers are still required to keep up to date. On the other hand, job search monitoring is suspended during the entire period of confinement.

The improved short-time working scheme is part of a broader rescue package adopted by the Federal Government at the end of March 2020, in order to cushion the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the closure of many businesses.

They do not need to apply directly for the reimbursement but declares sick pay costs in their usual PAYE tax return for these months. The Swedish Tax Agency then forwards the information to the Social Insurance Agency, which then compensates the employer.Self-employed persons will also be compensated in that they can receive standardized sick pay for days 1–14.","All employers in Sweden are covered by this measure.

The new system means that individual employers affected by temporary and serious financial difficulties that could not reasonably have been foreseen or avoided will be able to receive support for a limited period of time. The aim of the measure is thus to dampen the effect of the ongoing health crisis and save jobs by easing the financial burden of wage costs for companies experiencing difficulties. Short-time work (also known as short-time layoffs) is regulated in the Act (2013:948) on short-time work (Lag (2013:948) om stöd vid korttidsarbete).","Short-time working means that employers can reduce their employees’ working hours and receive financial support from the central government to compensate for a significant part of the costs for retaining the employee. This measure covers only the private sector. This measure is not available for sole traders. Working-time can be reduced by up to 60% (although this is likely to shortly be extended to 80%). The support is intended to correspond to 75% of the employer’s costs after the reduced working hours. The basis of calculation is ordinary salary (or wage for hourly employees) excluding the employer’s social insurance contributions, however to still take the statutory employer’s social insurance contributions of 31.42% into account, the share of support will be 98.6%, i.e. 75% of 1.3142 = 98.565%.The application to receive such support opened on April 7 but will be retroactively applied to as early as from 16 March.Employers wishing introduce short-time work must first ensure that they have the possibility for short-time working in their central and local collective bargaining agreement. Employers whose employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement must instead sign an agreement for short-time working covering at least 70% of the employees at the operating unit. ","The use of short-term work is likely to be widespread. One day after the application openened, the administrating authority - The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth - had already received 15,000 applications. By 13 July 2020 approximately 73,500 companies had applied for support. The amount of support that has been paid out is SEK 26 billion (approximately €2,6 billion). The number of employees covered by this measure was approximately 570,000. ",National government; Public support service providers,Employees in standard employment,National funds,"The Swedish Federation of Business Owners welcomes this measure.

Those who do not yet have one can get one through their 'Finanzonline' account or with their Citizen Card. Those who have neither access to 'Finanzonline' nor a citizen card can apply for an electronic AMS account by email or phone. Then, however, the processing can take a few days. If waiting is not an option, unemployed can also register as unemployed using a form on the AMS website. It is also possible to report unemployment by email. The last option is to call the AMS to have the necessary forms sent to you by post.For those who receive unemployment benefits and the entitlement period would come to an end (thus receiving the lower emergency assistance), the 'Corona crisis period' is not calculated towards this entitlement, i.e. unemployment benefits are prolonged for the duration of the crisis.","Compared to February (333,987 unemployed persons), there was in increase in the number of unemployed both in March (504,345) and in April (522,253).

Also self-employed with income losses will be eligible for this support.","Measures against child poverty are to be strengthened, family minister Anschober said: There are now payments to families who have been pushed into short-time work or unemployment by the current crisis.

From 15 April 2020, parents who had been employed until 28 February and are now on  short-time work or have become unemployed due to the crisis are eligible. Self-employed persons with losses could also apply for payment. This applies to families with children who receive family allowance.

Even if there are payment difficulties, there will be no shutdowns on the part of the energy suppliers.","Until further notice, in any case until May 1st, ""no one in Austria will turn off electricity, gas or heat, "" the minister and the E-Control board assured.

However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.This measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  ","In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists.

If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (€100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. The amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than HRK 150,00, nor more than HRK 1.500,00.

This quick initiation was possible because the country had already prepared to start electronic prescriptions in a pilot project in two political districts in the regional province in Carinthia in April 2020. The measure is targeted especially to those who need long-term medication. It stands to be seen whether it will be prolonged after the Corona crisis is over.In addition to the electronic prescription, further measures for the period of the pandemic were introduced, including for instance the suspension of the authorization requirement (chief physician requirement) for many medications. Furthermore, ambulance transports are free of charge until further notice; the same applies to medical aids and aids up to a total of €1,500 as well as X-ray and cross-sectional examinations. Sickness reports to doctors are currently also possible by telephone. Doctors, psychotherapists and midwives can also invoice necessary telemedical treatments (via Skype, video conference or telephone) such as a service performed in the ordination.","The procedure of getting an electronic recipe is that the patient calls the doctor's office. The doctor issues the prescription and saves it in the patient's (pre-existing) e-medication. The information reaches the pharmacy automatically via e-medication. There, the patients can either pick up the medicine themselves or send someone.In cases where e-medication is not working or is not yet working, doctors were also given the opportunity to send prescriptions to the pharmacies by fax or email. The electronic prescription is primarily intended to help older people and people with previous illnesses to avoid medical practices as best they can given the spread of coronavirus in Austria. Accordingly, the measure is mainly intended for people with long-term medication. However, in principle, it is also possible that the doctor prescribes medication for acute cases.

To counteract this, a package of measures was first presented by the government on 19 March. The criminal prosecution of the perpetrators would be further ensured, entry and proximity bans would be further pronounced, and directions would be implemented. This would mean that the police can give those affected by domestic violence applications for an injunction against violent partners at first contact and take the completed forms with them on inspection visits a few days later. Applications can also be submitted electronically. The removal of violent offenders would also be guaranteed in quarantine areas. On 5 April, new measures where presented and figures showing a slight decrease in the number of domestic violence cases.","When presenting measures in mid-March, it was emphasised that the 24-hour helpline had been increased in terms of funding and staff and that online advice for women at risk of violence was expanded.

Due to travel bans, maintaining this care has become a major problem. But also those who are cared for by family members may encounter capacity problems, as well as those in older people's homes or care homes, when staff get sick or are in quarantine.Thus, the government has announced to provide a specific COVID-Fund worth €100 million for the 460,000 persons in need of care, to be distributed among Austria's nine federal states (as nursing care lies within their competencies). It lies within the regional states' responsibility on how to invest this money.

This was on top of a series of measures announced at Budget 2020 on the 12 March, where the government announced GBP 30 billion of additional support for public services, individuals and businesses experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.  Changes to SSP were part of the initial Budget package, subsequently extended on the 17 March, and accounted for in Sections 39 to 44 of the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 40 amends the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.  Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, the changes in SSP will be back-dated to 13th of March.","In order to traditionally qualify for SSP (currently £94.25 and payable by employers for a maximum of 28 weeks), there is a wait of three days before an individual employee becomes eligible. However, under the new ruling, SSP will be paid from day 1, rather than day 4 of an individual's absence from work if that person is absent from work due to sickness or the need to self-isolate caused by COVID-19. This applied retrospectively from the 13th of March. Moreover, from the 20th of March onwards, those who have COVID-19 or who are advised to self-isolate will be able to obtain an “isolation note” by visiting the National Health Service (NHS) 111 online and completing an online form, rather than visiting a doctor. For COVID-19 cases, this replaces the usual need to provide a “fit note” after seven days of sickness absence. For those not eligible for SSP e.g. the self-employed or those earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of GBP 118 per week, but who have COVID-19 or are advised to self-isolate, the government says that they can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit (UC) or new style Employment and Support Allowance. For those who are self-employed and receiving Universal Credit with COVID-19 or advised to self-isolate, the requirements of the Minimum Income Floor will be temporarily relaxed. This change took effect on 13 March and will last for the duration of the outbreak, to ensure that self-employed UC claimants will receive support.",,National government,Employees in standard employment,National funds,"The Chancellor is reported to have met and worked with trade unions and business groups, in order to support peoples' financial security. There is evidence on Hansard (official record of proceedings in Parliament) that the  Chancellor 'spoke to the trade unions' on the 18th of March and on the 19th of March, he met with the TUC, the CBI, the BCC and the FSB. This was done with a view to urgently developing new forms of employment support to help protect people’s jobs and incomes through this period (see https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2020-03-19/debates/8B1662BD-F065-4731-AA48-5BA21424C2D0/Covid-19EmploymentSupport). There are no explicit details of discussion.Previously, the TUC had called for changes to the SSP system. On the 18th of March, the TUC stated that the sick pay system is 'broken', stating that at a maximum of £94.25 per week, Statutory sick pay (SSP) is not enough to live on. The TUC further averred that the average worker earns £512 per week, so for the estimated 7 million people who may come to rely on SSP, any time off work will constitute 'a large income shock.'The TUC also pointed out that many people aren’t eligible for SSP, as approximately 2 million people do not qualify for such payments due to the fact that they do not meet the lower earnings limit of £118 per week. The TUC criticised the Chancellor for not extending eligibility for sick pay to these lower earners; he instead pointed them to the benefit system. He has announced minor improvements to the way the benefit system operates, but the TUC is still critical that the system will fail to provide appropriate support, mainly due to the five-week wait for first payment and the low level of benefits then provided (Employment and Support Allowance is just £73.10).The TUC thus called on the government to remove the lower earnings limit for qualification for sick pay. It also urged the government to immediately increase the weekly level of SSP (£94.25) to at least the equivalent of a week’s pay at the Real Living Wage, as well as to end the five-week wait for benefits (see https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/coronavirus-help-what-workers-need-now).",Unknown,Consulted,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878995/Covid-19_fact_sheet.pdf; https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents; https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19; https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works

This includes landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19. Where a tenant is experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19, the government will ensure they do not face the threat of eviction for at least three months:* The government has agreed with mortgage lenders that they will offer repayment holidays of three months to households in financial difficulty due to COVID-19.* This will also apply to landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.* The offer of a payment holiday can be made available to customers who are up to date with payments and not already in arrears.* Customers who are concerned about their current financial situation should contact their lender at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss whether this is a suitable option for them.* Under the Coronavirus Act, landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a three month period. This applies to private and social renters.* At the end of this period, landlords and tenants will be expected to work together to establish an affordable repayment plan, taking into account tenants’ individual circumstances. ","Currently unknown.However, research by the Resolution Foundation published on the 30th May (Judge, 2020), analysed the findings of a YouGov survey of 6000 working-age adults, focusing on levels of housing stress, and how families in different housing tenures are coping.The study found that while the earnings hit has been widely experienced across tenure groups, renters are one-and-a-half to two times more likely to have fallen behind with their housing payments compared to mortgaged home owners. Owners entered the crisis with lower average housing costs and a bigger financial buffer than renters, and have also been more successful at directly reducing housing costs in recent weeks. While just one-in-twelve home owners applying for a mortgage holiday have been refused, that figure stands at one-in-two for those renters who have sought a rent reduction. While the social security system potentially offers a (more generous) backstop for renters, eligibility rules and caps leave some renters without adequate support. The study showed that one-third of new benefit claimants are in housing cost arrears.  ",National government,,No special funding required,"The measure first applied only to those with mortgages.

For this, the Executive has approved that, in the event that a company suspends its activity due to the health crisis, the temporary contracts that its workers have (including training, relief and interim contracts) are also suspended. After this crisis, the duration of these eventual contracts will be prolonged for the time they have been suspended.","The suspension of temporary contracts, including training, relief and interim contracts, for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of March 17, will mean the computation will be interrupted, both for the duration of these contracts, as well as the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period, in each of these contractual modalities, with respect to the workers affected by them.Article 5 of RDL 9/2020 provides that the suspension of temporary contracts for the causes provided for in articles 22 and 23 of RDL 8/2020, including training, relief and interim contracts, means the interruption of the computation of both the duration of such contracts as of the reference periods equivalent to the suspended period.Thus, RDL 9/2020 does not indicate that the causes of force majeure, or the economic, technical, organizational or production related to the COVID-19 constitute an enabling budget so that the parties can proceed directly to the suspension of the temporary employment contracts. On the contrary, RDL 8/2020 refers to the suspensions of contracts decided by the company, after confirmation of the force majeure by the competent Labor Authority, or after processing the consultative and negotiating period. Therefore, the paralysis of the effects of the reciprocal obligations of the parties to the temporary contract requires that the causes concur and that the expressed procedural rules have been followed. It is for these assumptions and conditions that it is established that the suspension also has the additional, and exceptional, effect of interrupting the calculation of the term of life or duration of the temporary contract.The norm refers to temporary contracts in general, although it is specified that training, relief and interim contracts are included.The interruption of the calculation means that the period of suspension of the contract does not count for the purposes of determining neither the agreed term of validity nor the maximum duration.

'The trade is fundamentally against any legal shortening of the opening times' said WKÖ trade chairman Peter Buchmüller. The food trade in particular is an important infrastructure for maintaining the security of supply for the entire population and is 'well equipped'. Due to the recent measures by the federal government, the shopping behavior of Austrians has changed. Social partners notice that customers shop less often, but buy more. The customer frequency decreases at a later hour. Therefore, the commercial social partners have agreed to adjust the opening hours accordingly.

This might include (but will not be limited to) recently retired professionals and students who are near the end of their training. Registered staff can then be used appropriately, with decisions made on a local basis, to increase the available health and social care workforce and enable essential health and care services to function during the height of the epidemic;* enable regulators to temporarily add social workers to their registers who may have recently left the profession. This will ensure vital continuity of care for vulnerable children and adults;* enable employees and workers to take Emergency Volunteer Leave in blocks of 2, 3 or 4 weeks’ statutory unpaid leave and establish a UK-wide compensation fund to compensate for loss of earnings and expenses incurred at a flat rate for those who volunteer through an appropriate authority. This will ensure that volunteers do not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of performing a public good. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of health and social care services and are particularly important in caring for the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly, those with multiple long-term conditions or those suffering from mental ill-health;* provide indemnity for clinical negligence liabilities arising from NHS activities carried out for the purposes of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, where there is no existing indemnity arrangement in place. This will ensure that those providing healthcare service activity across the UK are legally protected for the work they are required to undertake as part of the COVID-19 response. This is in line with and will complement existing arrangements; * suspend the rule that currently prevents some NHS staff who return to work after retirement from working more than 16 hours per week, along with rules on abatements and drawn-down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work. This will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and also allow retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.","More than 60,000 retired doctors and nurses who had retired in the last three years were written to and told ""Your NHS Needs You"", urged to come back to the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.  Student nurses and medical students are also being offered temporary work as the health service struggles to cope with rising demand and growing staff shortages.  Officials said those who join the ""NHS Army"" by re-registering with regulators will be assessed to see what kind of help they could offer in the battle against the pandemic.On the 27th of March, retired police officers were also asked to return to work, in either a voluntary or paid capacity. Those officers nearing thirty years' pensionable service have also been asked to delay retirement. The request came as one in five police officers were off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus.  The Met, which is Britain’s biggest force, is already understood to be experiencing absentee rates of 20%. This already high figure came before London hits its peak, with officers and staff missing because they have contracted the virus or are having to self-isolate.Finally, the Government and NHS England called for a 'volunteer army' to help the vulnerable during the coronavirus crisis. Over 750,000 people in just four days signed up the NHS's call for volunteers, three times the original target. On the 7th of April, the Royal Voluntary Service, the charity delivering the volunteer effort, completed checks for the three quarters of a million applications and from the 8th, the NHS Volunteer Responders will support 2.5 million at risk people. Their duties will include: delivering medicines from pharmacies;  driving patients to appointments; bringing them home from hospital; •making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home; and transporting medical supplies and equipment for the NHS.Thousands of these approved volunteers will be offered tasks from the 8th via the GoodSAM app and will start helping people safely, with more expected to get requests over the coming weeks as referrals ramp up.Health professionals, pharmacists and local authorities can upload requests for help on the NHS Volunteer Responders referrer’s portal and volunteers pick the job they want to do that day and close the task once complete.  Volunteers show themselves as available when their app is switched to ‘on duty’.","750,000 volunteers signed up to assist NHS England.	The call for retired NHS staff resulted in 11,788 retired medical staffers returning to work, including 2,660 doctors and 6,147 nurses.

The Hardship Fund will provide council tax relief to help those affected most by coronavirus. The funding will go to local authorities in England to enable them to reduce the 2020 to 2021 council tax bills of working age people receiving Local Council Tax Support. Councils will also be able to use the funding to provide further discretionary support to vulnerable people through other support arrangements such as Local Welfare Schemes.Guidance for the GBP 500 million Hardship Fund was released on the 24th of March, aimed at providing clarity to local authorities on how to allocate the funding following its announcement at Budget.This amends s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.","In the Guidance issued, the Government states that it recognises that COVID-19 is likely to cause fluctuations in household incomes and that, as a result, some individuals may struggle to meet council tax payments. It says that councils will already have established their local council tax support schemes for 2020-21 and that the Government therefore expects that billing authorities will primarily use their grant allocation to reduce the council tax liability of individuals in their area, using their discretionary powers under s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. Further, it states that councils may also want to use some funding to deliver increased financial assistance through other local support mechanisms, having considered local circumstances.The Government states that councils should expedite provision of support to individuals in their area, using existing policies and schemes to deliver assistance where practical. Where council clearance processes are considered necessary, to avoid delays, they should be kept as light touch as possible within the governance arrangements of each authority.It also states that council tax reductions should be applied as soon as possible from the beginning of the 2020-21 financial year and billing authorities should rebill council taxpayers as quickly as practical. Authorities will want to make the local population aware of how the grant support package will be delivered, e.g. through providing information on their websites.The Government confirms that it will fund billing authorities in full for the new burdens cost for delivering the support.  Local authorities will wish to maintain a record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms.","On the 16th of April, the UK Government issued more guidance, in which it stated that all working-age Local Council Tax Support (LCTS) claimants in 2020-21 (who are entitled to working-age LCTS in respect of any part of the 2020-21 council tax liability) will receive a further discount of £150 under the Hardship Fund.

The aim of this measure is to facilitate for health and medical care students to help out in the health care sector without their student aid being reduced. However, the measure does not exclusively cover health and medical students as also other occupations are deemed key in the current crisis, and also so as to support those newly unemployed who now wish to start studying.The student aid income ceiling is regulated in The Act (1999:1395) on student aid (Studiestödslag (1999:1395)).","In practice, the removal of the income ceiling means that students who have received higher incomes during 2020 than the initially set limit (of SEK 86,782 during half a calendar year), will keep all of their student grants and loans.For students who are short of credits due to their school being unable to provide teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, the administrating authority (The Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN)), will take this into consideration. And those who have difficulties repaying their loans due to the COVID-19 related situation will be given the possibility to postpone or reduce the payment.","As all students are eligible, the use of this measure might be widespread. However, as many might not be able to work as usual or might even lose their jobs, the removal of the income ceiling will likely not affect all students.",National government,Particular professions; Unemployed; Youth (18-25); People in care facilities,National funds,N/A,Unknown,Informed,No,Not specified,,No,,,https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/03/crisis-package-for-jobs-and-transition/; https://www.csn.se/languages/english/information-about-the-corona-virus.html

Rental leases for these companies cannot be terminated in this period, either, so tenants cannot be evicted, although it is not clear if this means on any grounds at all or whether landlords can exercise some of their rights to terminate.","Under Section 3 of government decree 47/2020, the sectors selected as one most affected by the COVID-19 crisis will receive protection from rent increase or rental contract termination. The measure applies to sectors where businesses typically rent rather than own their premises and where the economic impacts of covid-19 have caused financial strains. Although the measure does not specificy if rental contracts are banned from termination even if no rent is paid by the tenant at all, experts agree that with the eviction ban in place, tenants are likely to get away with not paying at all during the 'state of emergency' period while their business is likely to be closed down.","The measure could affect about 50,000 compaies, mainly SMEs in the COVID-vulnerable sectors. The rule overrides any rent increases stipulated in the rental contract. Legal experts say that if tenants do not pay rent at all, landlords are likely to seek agreement on special terms rather than lose clients on a shrinking property rental market.

The measure treats all industries equally, but will especially benefit the most vulnerable companies. The measure covers only limited liability companies, etc. which has gone from surplus in 2018 or 2019, to a deficit in 2020. The delimitation ensures that the companies that benefit from the measure are also suitable to make a profit. Thus, it is avoided that companies that are not fit to make a profit, or who do not initially do business, benefit from the measure.","Companies will have a temporary opportunity to return up to NOK 30 million of corporate deficits in 2020 against taxed profits the previous two years. The tax value of losses in 2020 will be paid to the companies at the tax settlement in 2021. One advantage of the measure is that the extent of payments to the companies depends directly on the severity of the situation. In this way, the measure reinforces the tax system's stabilizing role and ability to curb the decline. The Government proposes that an amount limit of NOK 30 million will be set for the amount of deficit in 2020 that can be reversed against previous profits.

This reinforcement of the loan fund will increase Almi’s preparedness to meet the needs of businesses whose activities have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.The Swedish Export Credit Corporation’s credit framework will be increased from SEK 125 billion to SEK 200 billion and can be used to provide both state-supported and commercial credit to Swedish export companies. This will give the agency enhanced opportunities to meet the export industry’s increased demand for credit.The Swedish Export Credit Agency promotes Swedish exports and the competitiveness of Swedish industry by providing guarantees that facilitate the financing of purchases of Swedish goods and services. Increased credit guarantees totalling SEK 500 billion and lower risk for banks will provide new and improved credit opportunities for companies. A new guarantee for faster and more secure payment to Swedish export companies will also be introduced.

These new rules allow for the coverage of: employees with an annual working time account (forfaits jours) in days or hours - i.e. employees whose working hours cannot be fixed in advance (often managers); civil aviation crews, freelance journalists (who are paid for each article ordered); salespeople with the status of sales representatives (VRP); home-based employees paid on a piecework basis; intermittent entertainment workers and models.

This decree is applicable to short-time compensation claims submitted from 12 Marc 2020 to 31 December 2020. For the two main categories of workers covered, the rules are the following:1/ Employees with a ""forfait jours"" in hours and daysFor employees whose working hours are fixed by a 'forfait-jours"" agreement in hours or days over the year, both the allowance and the short-time work allowance are determined by taking into account the number of hours or days or half-days not worked by the employee. The number of hours taken into account is determined by converting a number of days or half-days into hours according to the following flat-rate periods:- a half-day not worked corresponds to 3.5 hours not worked;- a day not worked corresponds to 7 hours not worked;- a week not worked corresponds to 35 hours not worked.Days of paid leave and rest taken during the period of suspension or reduction of activity, as well as public holidays not worked which correspond to working days, are converted into hours according to the same procedures.2/ Civil aviation flight crewIn the case of civil aviation flight crews, whose working hours are organised in the form of alternating days of activity and days of inactivity, the number of hours giving rise to the payment of the allowance and the partial activity allowance shall be determined on the basis of a number of eligible days of inactivity. The latter is determined by taking into account the difference between the number of days of inactivity recorded and the number of days of inactivity normally guaranteed to the employee over the period in question. The number of days of inactivity obtained is converted into hours according to the following rule: each day of inactivity in excess of the number of days of inactivity guaranteed corresponds to 8.75 hours off work, within the limit of the legal weekly duration (35 hours) over the period in question.",No data available.,National government,Employees in standard employment; Workers in non-standard forms of employment,National funds,The government has probably consulted social partners in the design phase of the measure.,Direct consultation,Consulted,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000041762506&categorieLien=id; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041804453

As of 1 April, 61,000 companies, including all the major players in the sector, representing 565,000 employees (i.e. 50% of the profession) had applied for this, according to the DARES.To break the deadlock, the profession has therefore drawn up, under the aegis of the OPPBTP, its professional prevention body managed on an equal footing, this guide which is supposed to 'provide the conditions for employees to continue working in safety'.","Having received the approval of all the ministries concerned, the guide defines the protocols to be respected with the approval of clients and within the framework of social dialogue, the conditions of use of individual protection, respect for barrier gestures, and the procedures to be followed in the event of travel, for example.These measures are capable of ""enabling a gradual resumption of activity"", as all the employers' federations have stressed.

The agreement covers the following issues: telework, full time arranged activity, short-time work, ""fourteen"" and work stoppage. All the measures will apply for the period from 16 March to 30 April 2020, 'possibly with retroactive effect for this period, depending on the situations already in place'.","The main subjects addressed by the agreement are:1. **Use of teleworking**On a temporary basis and depending on the activity and the technological possibilities available, Daher has set up teleworking ""for a maximum number of group employees whenever possible"". It is up to the manager to regularly assess the workload and the ability of each individual to telework. The manager regularly informs the employee of his or her continued teleworking, or of the possibility of returning to the site ""for service requirements that cannot be carried out remotely"", or of being partially teleworking.2. **Adaptation of work organisation**In some sectors of the company, the work organisation had to be adapted in order to comply with the instructions for taking up work at the post (cleaning, extended or moved lunch break, etc.). In the context of this ""adjusted full-time activity"", the company undertakes, despite a potential reduction in working hours, to maintain employee remuneration, including team bonuses, basket bonuses, meal vouchers or equivalent meal allowance in the absence of closed collective catering, etc. Moreover, ""as a completely exceptional measure and to take into account the commitment of the employees"", the hours not worked due to these adjusted schedules will not give rise to any recuperation.3. **Organisation of short-time working**""In accordance with government directives known to date"", ""alternative systems"" to be used before the implementation of the partial activity system are identified in each company. As part of the agreement, and ""subject to the approval of the administration"", the equivalent of a seven-hour day taken as ""time bank/flexible/ reduced working hours (RTT)"" for non-management employees. For managers, one day of RTT (two for metalworking managers) is taken on a mandatory basis. In addition, the agreement continues, the setting of five working days of paid leave over the period of the agreement is imposed.4. **Remuneration during short-time working**In an approach aimed at preserving purchasing power, Daher raises the remuneration of employees on short-time working to 95% of their net salary, ""instead of the 84% of net salary provided for by law"". In return for this matching contribution and in solidarity with employees whose activity will have been maintained, employees in partial employment will, before December 31, 2020, and as soon as the confinement period has ended, perform up to 25 hours of activity for non-managers and three days for managers, for each full month of partial unemployment. 5. **The ""fourteen-week"" period**In the event that, for safety or health reasons, the employee is sent home at the initiative of the employer or at the request of the client, it is up to the company to find a solution to temporarily offer him/her another assignment or to transfer him/her to another status.For the employee who wishes to take up an assignment at his own initiative ""in a fortnight"" and whose situation is not recognised by the health insurance fund, the company ""shows adaptation and kindness"" to enable him to use as far as possible any other more advantageous arrangement in terms of maintaining remuneration (paid leave, RTT, time bank, flexible, etc.).6. **Work stoppage**In the event of a work stoppage (illness, childcare, population at risk at COVID-19, maternity, etc.), the employee benefits from the compensation scheme provided for, via the daily social security benefits and the employer's supplement set according to the Daher Group.

The objective of the social partners is to 'preserve the protection of the health and safety of the employees present while maintaining the company's operations as much as possible'.","The temporary adjustment applies, from 19 March to 2 April, to employees working in the 'Manufacturing Front-End and Back-End' and support departments at the Crolles (Isère), Grenoble (Isère), Rennes (Ille-et-Vilaine), Rousset (Bouches-du-Rhône) and Tours (Indre-et-Loire) plants.In order to guarantee 'these essential activities related to the safety of the installations and the quality of the products and services', the teams are reduced. The agreement provides that they may be reduced by up to 50% of the theoretical workforce, with a minimum of two employees per sector. Over the period, the management must draw up a provisional schedule for the composition of the teams, ensuring that there are rotations between employees. In the event of an unforeseen additional absence, one or more employees may be called in to complete the team. In any event, the provisional schedule is adapted on a daily basis to take into account any changes in the situation.The employees affected by this reduction in activity shall not suffer any loss of remuneration and shall be paid at the normal time, 'as if they had worked full time according to their usual working hours'. In other words, the agreement specifies that the rest days imposed on certain employees will be considered as actual working time for the calculation of remuneration elements.In addition, to limit physical contact, the agreement provides that employees travelling to the sites may travel with their personal vehicle. These trips are financed by the company in the form of mileage allowance payments on the June 2020 payroll at the latest.  All STMicroelectronics employees other than Manufacturing and Production Support who travel to their place of work at the request of their management are also eligible for this measure.Finally, a systematic temperature reading can be taken at the entrance to the sites. In the event that the temperature exceeds a limit set by the central health, safety and working conditions commission (CSSCT) and the occupational physician coordinating France, employees are invited to go home and consult their treating physician or log on to the health insurance website to obtain a work stoppage.","The agreement applies to production workers of STMicroelectronics which employs about 10,100 people in France.

But it also underlines the right of everyone to preserve their health and to work safely. Faced with contradictory demands, the signatories call for an appropriate social dialogue in companies. They add that they would like company negotiations to be favoured so that the branch agreement plays exclusively its supplementary role, in accordance with the Labour Code. The agreement of 3 April 2020 does not therefore call into question the company agreements already signed, nor the company negotiations currently underway.*Short-time working*The agreement invites companies to 'seek with the social partners, beyond the preservation of employment, a change in the conditions of compensation' for short-time working, 'to mitigate its negative impacts' (on the purchasing power of employees).The agreement recalls that the period of short-time working can be used for training actions. It adds that when occupational health and safety conditions are ""irreproachable, guaranteed and applied"", the training action can be implemented ""in situ"", within the company, if necessary, in a work situation. In this context, the joint body in charge of vocational training (OPCO 2i) is invited to provide collective training actions for employees of VSEs and SMEs.

It targets enterprises in the horti- and agricultural sectors as a whole because this sector was one of the first to feel a marked hit from the crisis. This includes the provision of food and other grown products, not just for domestic consumption but also for trade.

These sectors are all confronted by an international and domestic decrease in demand for their produce.The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit - LNV), will therefore temporarily underwrite working capital granted to farms and horticultural companies under the the Guarantee for Agricultural SME Credit, (Borgstelling MKB-Landbouwkredieten), which is part of the Guarantee SME Loans scheme for small and medium-sized farms and enterprises.In this way, the government will act as a guarantor for loans granted to farms. The government seeks to ensure that the scope of this scheme will be broadened in the short term. Enterprises can seek credit to bridge their troubled times of up to €15 million, for which the Ministry of LNV will act as guarantor for up to 70%.

Instead of submitting their accounts on 1 April, they may now do so by 1 June 2020 instead.* Subsidies to cultural institutes will be paid out by the government and there is an easing of the rule that subsidies are reduced if planned performance targets are not met by the institutes. This also applies to subsidies to specific projects and initiatives; subsidies will still be paid even if certain planned targets are not met. The six main national cultural funds will also help to implement the measures above and so doing, help the cultural institutes those respective funds support.The measure applies to enterprises as well as institutes.

As part of these measures, the Revenue service operates a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The scheme enables employees whose employers are affected by the pandemic to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system. The scheme is expected to last 12 weeks from 26 March 2020.The scheme was introduced as part of the terms of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020.On Wednesday 15 April, the Minister for Finance announced further updates to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. ","The Scheme is available to employers from all sectors (excluding the public service and non-commercial semi-state sector) whose business activities are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.It is open to employers who retain staff on payroll; some of the staff may be temporarily not working or some may be on reduced hours and/or reduced pay. Provided the employer meets certain conditions and, subject to the levels of pay made to employees, the employer may be eligible for the scheme for some, or all of its employees.The employer includes the subsidy as part of the employees’ wages in addition to any amount that the employer would otherwise be able to pay. The subsidy element on the employee’s payslip is indicated as a payment described as “GovCov19 WageSub”.  A subsidy of 85% is payable for employees whose net weekly income does not exceed €412. A subsidy of 70% is payable for those whose net weekly pay was previously no more than €500 but less than €586, with a cap of €410.To qualify for the Scheme, employers must be experiencing significant negative economic disruption due to COVID-19, be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Revenue, a minimum of a 25% decline in turnover and be unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully. They must also retain their employees on the payroll.The scheme is confined to employees who were on the employer’s payroll as at 29 February 2020, and for whom a payroll submission was made to Revenue in the period from 1 February 2020 to 15 March 2020.","47,400 employers are registered with Revenue for the scheme.According to the minister responsible, on 29 April 2020, 'The cumulative value of payments made to employers under the scheme is €652 million, almost 400,000 employees have now received at least one payment under the scheme'. According to preliminary statistics from the Irish Revenue, to 21 May:  * Over 55,500 employers registered with Revenue for the wage subsidy scheme.* Over 48,300 employers have already received subsidy payments.• Over 473,500 employees have already received at least one payment.Up to 5 June 2020, over 58,300 employers had registered for the TWSS and over €1.37 billion had been paid out. The scheme has supported over 514,700 employees who received at least one payment.

It will continue to play a vital role in enabling the economy to bounce back at the other end of this crisis, helping vulnerable firms to stay afloat and keeping their employees engaged whilst protecting the incomes of individuals.""__Patricia King, General-Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcomed the Government’s decision to establish a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to maintain jobs and support workers’ incomes during this unprecedented crisis, as first called for by ICTU in its letter of 18 March to the Taoiseach when we  outlined the urgent need for a 'temporary wage subsidy scheme’ that would help to keep workers in their jobs, protect them from unemployment and loss of income, and to help the economy rapidly recover when the COVID ends. ""These unprecedented times demand unprecedented measures to minimise the impact on workers, their families and the business community"",Patricia King said.When the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was amended to allow women who were on maternity leave to access the payment, this was welcomed by ICTU. ICTU and the National Women’s Council had campaigned to have the anomaly addressed.Ibec welcomed the extension of the TWSS to 31 August.

Mainly due to an undersupply of dwellings, house prices and rents are comparatively among the highest in Europe. Rents or mortgage payments are the largest proportion of income people in Ireland spend. The job or income losses due to the pandemic situation has aggravated this crisis, increasing the difficulty many people face with keeping up with mortgage and rent payments.

Renters may not be evicted from their home, or 2. Be served a notice of termination by their landlord.

Pre-empted by some of the registration bodies for doctors and nurses, the possibility for former health care staff to return to the register was enacted as part of the ‘Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020' on 27 March 2020.Medical and nursing schools in Ireland are fast tracking students to qualifications to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. A deal has also been reached between unions and the Health Service Executive to allow health care staff to be redeployed to private nursing homes. The Health and Safety Executive has launched a call to encourage health care workers to return to the service, as well as attracting health care workers from other countries currently in Ireland to assist with the effort to deal with COVID-19.In addition, it has also been made possible for public sector staff and teachers to be reassigned to other duties as required during the pandemic.","The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act passed in the Irish Parliament on 27 March 2020 introduces amendments to existing legislation in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The temporary provisions are intended ‘[…] to provide for the registration of certain health and social care professionals to fulfil the need for medical resources to alleviate the risk from COVID-19 to human life and public health and for those and related purposes to amend the Dentists Act 1985, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Pharmacy Act 2007, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, and the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011; […] to enable the re-enlistment of formerly enlisted persons; […]’. Prior to this (17 March), this Health Service Executive (HSE) launched the ‘Be on call for Ireland’ recruitment drive. This was aimed at the recruitment of additional qualified healthcare workers including medical, nursing and therapy personnel as well as healthcare assistants. On 10 April, the HSE announced that there will be an increase in the annual intake of medical interns this year, from 734 to approximately 1,100. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) and the Irish Medical Council also took steps to make it easier for nurses and doctors to return to the register (e.g. by waiving registration fees). The COVID-19 Act provides for health and social care professionals who want to return to work to have their applications to be registered with their regulatory bodies accelerated and returned to the register without paying a fee until 30 July 2020 (with possibility extend this date). Medical and nursing schools have also been fast-tracking students to qualification to deal with the pandemic.The Act also offers some protection to healthcare professionals, other than doctors, who may practise medicine during the pandemic (normally prohibited). They can do so under the direction and control of a registered medical practitioner, or in accordance with directions in writing given by a registered medical practitioner.With regard to other public servants and teachers, the Department of Education issued a circular to school managers on 27 March 2020 that indicated that all public servants 'must be available to carry out work either to deliver services within their own sector or for temporary assignment within the wider public service [...]'. The possibility to reassign public service staff is set out in Circular 7/2020, issued by the government on 17 March 2020.","A few days after the measure was enacted (1 April) the Irish Times reported that around 540 nurses and 140 doctors had re-joined the register. This famously includes the Irish Prime Minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar - who agreed to return to work to his former profession as a medical doctor for one day per week during the pandemic.In a statement to the Irish Independent, the HSE said: ""As of July 2, 194 doctors, nurses and health and social care appointees have been deployed from the Be on Call for Ireland initiative to HSE services in both community, acute and public health departments.

Workers and technicians in short-time working will thus be paid 92% of their net salary, instead of the 84% provided for by the legal system. This is made possible by the solidarity of managers on partial unemployment, whose net pay will increase from 100% to 92%.","Applicable until July 3, 2020, this agreement was put in place, thanks to the solidarity of managers and an additional contribution from the company, to erase the disparities in compensation between the different categories of employees, resulting from the legal provisions and the collective agreement of the Metallurgy. The agreement brings the remuneration of all employees to 92% of their usual net remuneration. According to the President of Renault Trucks France, ""this agreement makes it possible to treat all employees fairly during this unprecedented period of crisis. It offers each employee who wishes to do so, the opportunity to approach 100% of his or her remuneration through the use of days off, while safeguarding the future of the company. In addition to the solidarity contribution of the employees, the company's contribution amounts to 8% of the payroll"". In detail, on a voluntary basis, it is possible for all employees on short-time work to give 1.6 days for every 20 days they are unemployed to the company in order to keep their full pay. This agreement also secures the maintenance of individual salary increases with effect from 1 April 2020 and the payment of the profit-sharing bonus (prime d'intéressement) in June. The company will limit mandatory leave during the period of partial employment to a maximum of 5 days in 2020.","In total, Renault Trucks employs around 7,500 employees (excluding consultants and temporary workers) in France.

Three axes are planned to achieve this objective: * the creation of a ""social solidarity"" mechanism to supplement the remuneration of employees placed in partial activity situations; * the possibility of adapting the programming of holidays in each establishment; * the implementation of a reinforced protocol of barrier gestures. The agreement is applicable until  31 October 2020. The provisions concerning the creation of a solidarity fund will cease on 30 April 2020.","The main content of the measure consist of:1. **Solidarity Fund**Since March 16, 2020, all the activities of the group's industrial and commercial system have been stopped, which has led the company to place the vast majority of staff under the partial activity regime"", according to the agreement, which emphasizes that managers or technicians on fixed-days contracts already benefit from contractual provisions allowing them to maintain their remuneration in the event of partial unemployment. In order to enable all professional categories (employees, workers and technicians managers on lump-sum hours) to benefit from guaranteed remuneration for the period from 16 March to 30 April, the agreement sets up a solidarity fund. The fund will be financed by the payment of two days' leave for managers and one day for workers and technicians. Employees will be able to voluntarily pay the remainder of their paid leave that could not be used before 31 May 2020. For its part, PSA Automobiles undertakes to top up the days paid into the fund by 40%. These payments should make it possible to maintain employees' remuneration for a full month for 100% of the workforce. In the event that the partial activity is extended to all or part of the company's establishments, priority will be given to voluntary payments. If necessary, an additional number of days may be deducted. This may be done by half-day (excluding paid holidays) ""to adjust as best as possible to the gradual takeover of the sites"", up to a limit of 0.5 days for workers and technicians and one day for managers.2. **Arrangement of paid holidays**The agreement takes into account Order No. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020 allowing for the adaptation of the terms and conditions for taking paid holidays. Thus, each head of establishment will be able to impose the taking of six working days of leave during the period of partial activity, from 7 April to 31 October 2020. This week of paid leave may be taken either consecutively if the site's activity has been completely suspended, or non-consecutively if the site's activity is partially maintained.With regard to the setting of the weeks of paid summer holidays, each head of establishment will also be able to adjust their positioning, provided that each employee is guaranteed at least 12 consecutive working days over the period between 1 July and 31 August. In this context, the agreement provides for priority in the choice of dates for employees whose spouses cannot change their departure dates, for single-parent families, and for employees working 100% during the period of partial activity in their establishment. The latter will also be able to keep the previously set dates, or take three consecutive weeks of leave. In addition, their unused leave balance as of May 31, 2020 may exceptionally be carried forward until December 31, 2020. Finally, the agreement specifies that all employees who have not been able to take their remaining paid leave before May 31, 2020, due to the resumption of activity or the needs of the establishments, will be able to take these days until July 31, 2020.3. **An enhanced security protocol**The agreement recalls that, since the start of the health crisis at COVID-19, PSA Automobiles has adopted a reinforced health protocol of barrier gestures (wearing of masks on site, respect of distances with floor markings, ventilation of work spaces, longer break times for hand washing, etc.). Currently being rolled out at all industrial, commercial, service and engineering sites, these measures are subject to internal audits and assessment by health and safety committees to ensure their ""perfect"" implementation. A presentation of the audit reports as well as a field trip with members of the staff representative bodies will make it possible to share these conclusions, to assess their content and to correct, if necessary, the measures taken locally. In addition, management undertakes to implement communication and awareness-raising actions associated with the deployment of the enhanced security protocol.","The agreement applies to about 68,000 employees in France.",Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,Companies; Employees; National funds,"The agreement has been signed by four representative trade unions (CFDT, CFTC, CFE-CGC and FO), excepted the CGT.",Direct consultation,Negotiated,Yes,Only private sector,"C29 Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers",No,,,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiQ3eTP66bpAhWPwMQBHc0SDYsQFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.industriall-europe.eu%2Fcontent%2Fdocuments%2Fupload%2F2020%2F4%2F637224848804873772_PSA-accord-social-solidaire-protecteur-de-la-sant%25C3%25A9-des-salari%25C3%25A9s-et-de-lentreprise.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1VLW_b5H7cCy8PwY5UYVe

Another case of outbreak concerns a postal distribution center in Inzersdorf, Vienna, where 72 employees were tested positive. In both cases, contract tracing showed a link to the deployment of workers from a temporary work agency - some of which had been brought in shared buses to their workplace. ","Management from the Post had therefore requested help from the armed forces. The site was first disinfected by specialists from the Austrian armed forces team.

Up to 290 soldiers and civilian staff from the armed forces, NBC defence and the army base were deployed there. To minimise the risk of infection, the Army took sophisticated security precautions: All employees deployed were specially instructed in the procedures and protective measures before starting work, and throughout the logistics centre they were wearing mouth and nose protectors, gloves and safety shoes. In addition, separate recreation and sanitary areas were defined for the soldiers and civilian employees on site. Thus, there was no contact with the postal employees.

In business, however, there is also a need for spaces that entrepreneurs rent to a significant extent from the owners. This measure in the form of a law is aimed at helping entrepreneurs who rent business premises and for which they have to pay rent. The state subsidy will go to pay part of the rent for the use of the premises, which were closed due to a government regulation for the spread of coronavirus.","First, there is a negotiation between the landlord and the tenant about the amount of discount. The state pays the landlord a subsidy in the same amount as he gives the entrepreneur a discount on rent. The ceiling is 50% of the amount of rent for the period of difficult use of space. In such a case, the landlord will forgive half of the rent and the other half of the rent will be refunded by the state. The tenant for the period will not pay anything for renting the premises. If the landlord and the tenant agree on a lower discount (e.g. 30%), the state will contribute equally (30%) and the rest (40%) must be paid by the entrepreneur renting the premises. In this case, the tenant can spread the payment of unpaid rent in instalments over 48 months. During the payment, the landlord is not entitled to unilaterally increase the amount of rent. The assistance provided to the tenant is financed from the resources of the state budget of the Slovak Republic. The maximum amount of the grant for one applicant is €800,000. The subsidy covers only rent, not energy supply.","Based on a mutual agreement, the renter will ask the landlord to submit an application for a rent subsidy for the period of difficult use. The application is submitted by the landlord on behalf of the tenant, on the landlord's own account. The application must be signed on behalf of both parties, by all authorized persons of both entities, with a qualified electronic signature. The application is submitted to the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic in the period from 23 June 2020 to 30 November 2020.

Measures include various projects: * Less rigid requirements for construction plans to boost the construction sector.* Tourist vouchers to help the tourist and hospitality sector. * State loans and grants to compensate the loss of income.* Financial incentives (loans and grants) to generate new investments and creation of new jobs. * Less rigid requirements for construction plans in agriculture and favorable agricultural rents (discounted or free of charge). Measures particularly address these sectors: tourism and hospitality, road transport, agriculture, manufacturing and others.","The second COVID-19 law intends to boost investments in the construction sector by an accelerated procedure in obtaining building permits. The law requires, for example, more rigid criteria from environmental organisations (at least 50 active members, 3 full-time employees holding a diploma in natural sciences, €10,000 of assets in the last three years) to participate in the procedure.The second and third COVID-19 laws help the tourist and hospitality sectors with tourist vouchers. Tourist agencies and organisers of sports events may issue vouchers instead of reimbursement for unrealised travels or events. Payment moratorium expires in 24 months. In order to revitalise the tourist sector, each permanent resident of Slovenia gets tourist vouchers (adults €200, minors €50), valid until 31 December 2020, to be spent on accommodation. The government estimates the cost of tourist vouchers at €345 million, while the multiplier effects are estimated to be €172 million.State grants and loans co-finance the loss of income in tourism and hospitality, provide support for manufacturing in the affected border areas, encourage digitalisation of companies and development projects. Micro, small and medium-sized companies as well as large companies affected by the pandemic are eligible. On top of this, the state gives €35 million to companies in the road transport industry, financial aid for managers of ski lifts, ranging from €1,000 to €12,200 per lift.Businesses meet less strict requirements for obtaining co-financing of investments until 30 June 2021. The incentives will be granted if the investment creates at least 10 jobs in the manufacturing or service sector, or 3 jobs in research and development within three years after its completion. The minimum threshold for investments is €12 million in manufacturing, €3 million in the service sector, and €2 million in research and development.Agricultural businesses may profit from less rigid requirements for building greenhouses, irrigation systems, and plantations until 31 December 2020, subsidies for the exploitation of geothermal energy for farming, or more favorable rents (discounted or free of charge) in agriculture.","More rigid criteria for environmental organisations raise concern in the public since new rules exclude environmental organisations from the procedure in obtaining the building permit. It is believed that new rules jeopardise the protection of nature. Adoption of this regulation is one of the motives for mass protests held every Friday evening.

The financing to SMEs will be done through the Cyprus Entrepreneurship Fund (CYPEF) and the bank institutes. Beneficiaries are SMEs with maximum number of employees to be 250 and the maximum amount of loan €1.5 million that are to be reimbursed over a period of twelve years.

According to the survey run by the Croatian Chamber of Economy which covered over 2,700 companies, 95% of companies had reported declines in turnover and 28% had suffered declines of 100%. Three-quarters of the companies surveyed, or 74%, reported drops in production, and a fifth of them, or 21%, had seen their production fall by 100%. Supply chains have also been impacted by the outbreak, with 61% of companies reporting problems. Forty-five percent of companies recorded declines in exports and 41% reported falls in imports. In such circumstances it is no wonder that 42% of those polled are considering layoffs and as many as 37% are thinking of closing down. Therefore, special measures were needed for micro-businesses, primarily by co-financing wages and granting them moratoriums on loan repayments. At the session held on June 29, 2020, the Croatian Employment Service Management Board adopted specific measure in this regard related to micro-entrepreneurs.","Target groups of employers are those who perform economic activity and employ up to 10 workers. Target groups of workers are all insured persons with the eligible employer, regardless of whether they have a permanent or fixed-term employment, including founders, members of the management board, directors, procurators, and business owners. The target group of workers does not include pensioners and foreigners from third countries whose residence and work permits have expired.Employers who use measures of the Croatian Employment Service (CES) and other organisations, cannot use both measures at the same time. If more than one business entity has the same founder or owner who individually employs less than 10 employees, and all business entities together have more than 10 employees, the support will not be granted. Employers can choose to suspend contractual obligations under active contracts of active labour market policy (ALMP) measures by CES that include the covering the cost of wages. At the end of the period of application of this measure, they will continue to use the ALMP measure in the remaining period. Employers need to prove that in June 2020 they had a decrease in income by at least 50% compared to June 2019, based on the submission of the VAT form for June 2020 and June 2019. If the employer operates for less than 12 months, it is necessary to prove a decrease in turnover by at least 50% in June 2020 compared to February 2020 based on the submission of the VAT form for June and February 2020. The monthly amount of the support is HRK 2,000 (€267) for July 2020 per full-time employee, while for part-time employees it is the proportional according to the contractual number of hours. The support period is July 2020, yet the Administrative Board of the Croatian Employment Service will decide each month on the extension of the measure.

The plan is focused on boosting economic recovery, following the UK's lockdown and the recent easing of restrictions. The Chancellor described the plan as the 'second phase' of response to the coronavirus crisis and as being about jobs. He began his speech by stating that the government will not accept rising unemployment and that it will do all it can to give 'everyone the opportunity of good and secure work.' The Plan for Jobs has 'a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs', given the 25% contraction in the UK economy in the preceding months and the predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility and Bank of England as to significant job losses.","These initiatives are aimed at supporting young people, who it is predicted, will be hardest hit by the crisis (the Chancellor reported that the under-25s are two and a half times more likely to work in a sector that has been closed e.g. retail and hospitality). The new Kickstart Scheme is thus a __'new programme to give hundreds of thousands of young people, in every region and nation of Britain, the best possible chance of getting on and getting a job.'__Under the scheme, employers will be directly paid to create new jobs for any 16 to 24-year-old at risk of long-term unemployment. These will have to be new jobs, as the funding will be conditional on proof that these jobs are additional.  The jobs will have to be 'decent'; with a minimum of 25 hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.  Employers will also have to provide 'Kickstarters' with training and support to find a permanent job. If employers meet these conditions, the Government will pay young people’s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads. Thus, for a 24-year-old, the grant will be around £6,500.Employers can apply to be part of the scheme from August.

Under the BBLS, businesses will be able to apply for quick and easy-to-access loans between £2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover; the maximum loan available under the Scheme is £50,000. No loan repayments are required for the first 12 months and the government will cover the interest repayments for the same period.For those businesses seeking more than £50,000, BBLS is intended to sit alongside the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).   Under CBILS, a participating lender can provide up to £5 million in the form of term loans, overdrafts, invoice finance or asset finance.  Both schemes are operated by the British Business Bank, through accredited lenders","The scheme helps small and medium-sized businesses to borrow between £2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover. The maximum loan available is £50,000. The government guarantees 100% of the loan and there are no fees or interest to pay for the first twelve months. After twelve months, the interest rate will be 2.5% a year.An SME can apply for the loan if the business: * is based in the UK* was established before 1 March 2020* has been adversely impacted by the coronavirus.SMEs from any sector can apply with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers); public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. If a firm is already claiming funding under the CBILS (a loan of up to £50,000), then this can be transferred into the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Businesses have until the 4th of November to arrange this with their lender. The loan will run for six yearsThe length of the loan is 6 years, but businesses can repay early without paying a fee. No repayments will be due during the first 12 months.The scheme is being run under the auspices of the British Bank, with eleven lenders participating in the scheme (including many of the main retail banks). Businesses should approach a suitable lender directly via the lender’s website. Applicants must complete a short online form and self-declare eligibility. The lender will make the decision as to whether a loan will be offered.","HM Treasury has published data on the total number of applications received, the number of successful applications and on the cumulative value of all loans/facilities granted.Thus, on the 10 May, 363,646 applications had been received, of which 268,173 had been successful with a value of £8.38 billion.

The Fund is aimed at innovative and high-growth British businesses, to facilitate their ability to secure investment during the coronavirus outbreak.  The Fund will be open until September and is delivered in partnership with the British Business Bank. It is part of the raft of financial measures. launched by the government as part of its response to the crisis. ","Announced by the Chancellor on the 20th of April, the Future Fund issues convertible loans from £125,000 to £5 million, to innovative UK companies with good potential, that typically rely on equity investment and are currently affected by Covid-19. The government funding is subject to at least equal match funding from private investors.These convertible loans may be an option for businesses that rely on equity investment and are unable to access other government business support programmes because they are either pre-revenue or pre-profit.The key features of the scheme are as follows. The application process is investor-led. This means an investor, or lead investor of a group of investors, applies in connection with an eligible company. The Future Fund will match up to 100% of the amount provided by investor(s), up to a maximum of £5 million.  The Future Fund loan amount provided to the company ranges from £125,000 to £5 million (this must be at least co-matched by investor capital).  Funding must not be used to * repay any borrowings;* pay any dividends; * pay any bonuses; * pay any advisory fees. The loans will have a minimum of 8% per annum (non-compounding) interest charge applied. This interest will be higher if the company and the investor(s) agree between themselves. Unlike a typical bank loan, the interest is not payable on a monthly basis and instead will accrue until the loan converts. At this point, the interest will either be repaid or convert in equity. The loan will mature after 36 months.  The loan cannot be repaid early by the company other than with the agreement of all of the investors.  The loans will convert into shares in the company in certain circumstances, including an exit or a new funding round.In order to be eligible for the scheme, each of the investor(s) and the company must meet specific criteria.To be eligible for the scheme, the company must meet the following criteria:1. The company must have raised at least £250,000 in equity from third-party investors in previous funding rounds in the last five years (from 1 April 2015 to 19 April 2020, inclusive).2. If the company is a member of a corporate group, it must be the ultimate parent company.3. The company does not have any of its shares or other securities listed on a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, a recognised investment exchange and/or any other similar market, stock exchange or listing venue.4. The company must be a UK incorporated limited company or be eligible to apply as a non-UK parent company.5. The company must have been incorporated on or before 31 December 2019 (or in the case of a non-UK jurisdiction company*, this criterion applies only to at least one UK subsidiary operating company).6. At least one of the following must be true for the company:* Half or more employees are UK based* Half or more revenues are from UK salesThe scheme's eligibility criteria have been amended to include innovative companies that participate in accelerator programmes based outside the UK.  Where before, these companies didn’t qualify because they had to register in an overseas jurisdiction to take part in an accelerator programme, the new criteria means they can now access the fund, providing they meet all other conditions for eligibility. The scheme is designed by government and delivered by the British Business Bank. Initially, £250 million was made available by the government for investment through the scheme, to be matched by private investors. However, the Treasury made clear that the amount could be increased if needed.  ","The Government has allocated £250 million to the Future Fund, which will initially run until the end of September. Government may extend the scheme thereafter.HM Treasury has published data on the total number of applications received, the numbers of successful applications and the (cumulative) value of all successful applications. On the 7 June, 533 applications had been received, of which 53 had been approved to a value of £55.9m.

In June, the temporary scheme was extended to last through 31 December 2020.","In March 2020, the social partners suggested that receivers of unemployment benefit should have a right to study while unemployed. The aim was to make the corona crisis an opportunity to raise the competencies of the population.

To achieve this, the social partners argued, it was necessary that the government relaxed the regulations for unemployment benefits and removed the restrictions that makes it difficult or impossible for employees to combine training with unemployment benefits.

Depending on the activity, this includes, for example, the possibilities for home office, redesigning workplaces to maintain a safe distance, installed barriers such as plexiglass walls or the use of personal protective equipment.The third COVID-19 Law paved the way for defining specific ""risk groups"", to which further protective measures apply. Employed workers with a very high risk of developing a serious illness if becoming infected with the Corona virus are entitled to work from their home office or to a change in working conditions (meaning that the working conditions must be designed in such a way that infection with COVID-19 is almost impossible, taking into account the way to work). Ultimately, if this is not possible, a paid temporary leave of absence can be obtained with full payment by the employer, who will be reimbursed in full by the social security system for the wage costs (including ancillary wage costs).An expert group consisting of three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Nursing and Consumer Protection, one representative from the Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, three representatives from the Medical Association and three representatives from the social security system held several meetings based on previous experience with COVID -19 sufferers in Austria's hospitals and the international scientific results identified the groups of people who could have a higher risk of developing a serious illness. ","The COVID-19 risk group regulation lists the medical reasons (indications) for belonging to the COVID-19 risk group. Based on these indications, a doctor may issue a COVID-19 risk certificate.The main medical indications are:1. advanced chronic lung diseases that require permanent, daily, dual medication2. chronic heart diseases with end organ damage that require permanent therapy, such as ischemic heart diseases and heart failure3. active cancer with oncological pharmacotherapy (chemotherapy, biologics) and / or radiation therapy within the past six months, and metastatic cancer even without ongoing therapy4. diseases that need to be treated with immunosuppression5. advanced chronic kidney disease6. chronic liver diseases with organ remodeling and decompensated liver cirrhosis from Childs stage B7. pronounced obesity from obesity grade III with a BMI> = 408. diabetes mellitus9. arterial hypertension with existing end organ damage, especially chronic heart or kidney failure, or uncontrollable blood pressure adjustment.These main medical indications are further divided and described in detail in the regulation.In addition, other, similarly serious diseases with functional or physical limitations can provide special protection through a COVID-19 risk certificate.Most members of the risk group were identified through their medication via their health insurance. They received letters by their social security institution after the legal provisions came into force in May. Furthermore, an individual risk analysis can be obtained by a physician (e.g. for patients with a cancer therapy who do not take any ""prescribed medication"" because they receive their treatment in the hospital or dialysis patients). The doctor carries out the risk assessment together with the patient based on the recommendations for individual risk analysis for a severe course of the disease. If there is a serious underlying illness that meets these recommendations, a COVID-19 risk certificate is issued.Employers and those affected must jointly consider whether special protective measures are possible in the workplace. If this is not possible, home office can be used. If this is not possible either, workers belonging to the risk group are entitled to paid leave from work.","According to information from the minister from 21 April 2020, around 90,000 workers are expected to belong to the risk group.

The candidate for the job can be stated in the application form or it can be selected (recruited) by the Employment Office.

In case the law stipulates that an institution or a person, who are not beneficiaries of a certain claim are authorized to initiate foreclosure or securing proceedings for such claim, such institution or a person act as creditors, i.e. submitters of motion in such proceedings. Foreclosure orders are issued exclusively on basis of enforceable or credible documents. Enforceable documents are: enforceable court decision and enforceable judiciary settlement, enforceable settlement from Article 186.a of the Law on Civil Proceedings, enforceable decision of arbitration court, enforceable decision passed in administrative proceedings and enforceable settlement in administrative proceedings, in case they refer to payment of a monetary claim and unless law stipulates otherwise, enforceable notarial decision and enforceable notarial document, settlements entered into in proceedings in front of court of honour at chambers in the Republic of Croatia and settlements entered into in mediation proceedings, in accordance with provisions of the law stipulating mediation proceedings, and other documents stipulated by law as enforceable documents. Pursuant to the Law on Enforcement, credible documents are invoices, bills of exchange, cheque with protest and returned invoices, whenever it is necessary to constitute a claim, public documents, extracts from commercial records, legally notarized private documents that are considered to be public documents in accordance with special regulation. Calculation of accrued interest is considered to constitute invoice.Foreclosure orders in the basis of enforceable documents are passed by courts and on the basis of credible documents by public notaries. Public notary is under obligation to issue and submit foreclosure order or to forward the file to the court within 30 days, at the latest, counting from the date of receipt of motion. Responsible institution for the foreclosure procedure is the Financial Agency (FINA). In case the debtor does not receive foreclosure, one more delivery shall be attempted within time limit that may not be shorter than 30 or longer than 60 days. In case of failed repeated delivery, document that had to be submitted shall be posted on court e-notice board. After that, in case debtor does not file a complaint, foreclosure order becomes valid and enforceable. Upon enforceability of foreclosure order, proceedings are continued in front of agency that implements foreclosure order in accordance with provisions of the Law on Enforcement and the law stipulating foreclosure of monetary assets. Further proceedings depend on whether the debtor has sufficient assets to pay the debt or not. Law on enforcement does not stipulate time limit in which foreclosure order must be issued. In practice, courts issue foreclosure orders within 2-3 months.","The government issued a decree on amendments to Zakon o provedbi ovrhe na novčanim sredstvima (The Act on the foreclosure on pecuniary assets) (OG 68/18, 2/20 and 46/20) and after the article 25, added two articles 25.a and 25.b) which define special circumstances when foreclosure can be postponed in special circumstances. Due to the Act, the Financial Agency (FINA) will not perform foreclosure procedure on pecuniary assets of natural persons. The Decree is valued for three months with the possibility on extension for next three months. During the mentioned period of postponed foreclosure, no income interest should be calculated and paid.  ","As many natural persons in Croatia face serious problems with foreclosure, such measure should be very welcomed in the circumstances of COVID19 and present financial difficulties.

This text was adopted pursuant to the Emergency Act to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic of 23 March 2020. As a reminder, the state of health emergency was declared for a period of two months from 24 March 2020, by the said emergency law, and has been extended to the 10 July 2020.","The main provision are the following:1. Authorisation of meetings via video/audio conferencing or instant messagingBy derogation from the Labour Code, the employer may convene the social and economic committee (CSE), the central CSE or another staff representative body provided for in the Labour Code using :* videoconferencing;* the telephone conference (audio conference), under the conditions to be laid down by decree;* or instant messaging, under the conditions to be set by a decree to be issued, if it is impossible to use videoconferencing or telephone conferencing, or when a company-wide agreement so provides. The employer may only have recourse to the instant messaging system in a subsidiary manner if it is impossible to organise the meeting by videoconference or telephone conference.In all cases, the employer must first inform the members of the body of these meeting arrangements.This measure is applicable to meetings convened during a state of health emergency (24 March 2020-10 July 2020).The limit of three videoconference meetings per calendar year provided for, in the absence of agreement, by Articles L. 2315-4 (for the CSE) and L. 2316-16 (for the Central CSE) of the Labour Code only applies to meetings organised outside the period of the state of health emergency.2. Consultation of the CSE in the event of a derogation related to working timeWhen an employer imposes or modifies the date of taking days off (within the limit of ten days), in application of the order no. 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, it must inform the CSE without delay and by any means. The CSE shall give its opinion within one month of receiving this information. The employer may act without waiting for the opinion of the ESC to be delivered.The same applies when an employer implements a derogation from working hours or Sunday rest, as a decree allows him to do so in application of the above-mentioned ordinance of 25 March 2020.3. Suspension of ongoing electoral processesThe ordinance suspends the ongoing professional election processes. Specifically, where the employer has informed the staff of the organisation of the elections before 3 April 2020, the current electoral process is suspended as of 12 March 2020.

Intended for companies facing a lasting reduction in activity, it can be implemented either by a company, establishment or group agreement validated by the administration, or by a document drawn up by the employer - on the basis of an extended branch agreement - and approved. It will apply until 30 June 2022. This temporary arrangement can be implemented until 30 June 2022. It complements the classic partial unemployment scheme (or ""partial activity"") which will be modified on 1 October 2020. An employer will not be able to combine the two schemes for the same employees over the same period.A reduction in activity limited to 40% of the legal durationThe APLD makes it possible to reduce the activity of employees, within the limit of 40% of the legal working time. This reduction in activity is assessed for each employee concerned, over the period of application of the system provided for in the collective agreement or unilateral document: this assessment framework therefore makes it possible to envisage a temporary suspension of activity.The 40% limit may be exceeded in exceptional cases resulting from the particular situation of the company, by decision of the administrative authority. However, the decree specifies that the limit may be exceeded only under the conditions laid down in the collective agreement and that the reduction in the working hours may not exceed 50 % of the legal duration.A capped allowance for employeesAs in the case of traditional partial activity, it is the employer who pays each employee placed in the APLD scheme directly an hourly allowance for partial activity, equal to 70 % of his gross remuneration serving as the basis for the holiday pay reduced to an hourly rate on the basis of the legal working time applicable in the company, or, where this is lower, on the basis of the collective working time or that stipulated in the employment contract. Employees therefore continue to benefit from the payment of 84% of their net salary.However, the compensation is capped: the maximum remuneration taken into account for the calculation of the hourly allowance is in fact equal to 4.5 times the hourly rate of the minimum wage.The partial activity allowance paid to employersThe employer receives a partial activity allowance, the hourly rate of which is equal for each employee concerned to:* 60% of the gross hourly pay corresponding to the basis of the holiday pay allowance, up to a limit of 4.5 times the hourly rate of the minimum wage, for agreements that will be sent to the administrative authority before 1 October 2020;* 56% of the gross hourly remuneration serving as the basis for the holiday pay allowance, for agreements transmitted to the administrative authority as from 1 October 2020, the date announced for the entry into force of the reformed arrangements for compensation for partial activity under ordinary law.It should be noted that the decree only covers the transmission of agreements: there is every reason to believe that the compensation rates will be the same for unilateral documents transmitted for approval before or as from 1 October 2020, and that the criterion to be taken into account is the date on which the application for approval or validation is sent.The hourly rate of the allowance is subject to a floor and may not be less than €7.23, with the exception of employees on apprenticeship or professionalization contracts.The content of the collective agreementWhether it is concluded at the level of the establishment, the undertaking, the group or the branch, the collective agreement setting up the long-term partial activity scheme must include a preamble presenting a diagnosis of the economic situation and business prospects of the establishment, the undertaking, the group or the branch.The agreement must then define :* the starting date and the duration of application of the long-term partial activity scheme;* the activities and employees to which the scheme applies;* the maximum reduction of working hours below the legal duration;* employment and vocational training commitments;* the procedures for informing the signatory employee trade unions and employee representative institutions about the implementation of the agreement, which must be provided at least every three months.Although the text does not expressly refer to it, the agreement must also lay down the conditions under which the 40% activity reduction limit may be exceeded: otherwise, such an overrun could not be authorised.",No data as the scheme is new.,National government,Employees in standard employment; Workers in essential services,Companies; National funds,Globally social partners support this scheme.,,,No,Only private sector,,No,,,https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000042169955&categorieLien=id; https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000042007059&categorieLien=cid

In the case of the 2020 subsidy, the amounts provided are €105 and €155 per week, respectively. The second offering of this scheme coincided with COVID-19, consequently Jobsplus clarified that only soft copy applications submitted via email would be accepted, that the scheme could not be used to re-hire those terminated due to redundancies, and that employers could not continue to claim for this subsidy if wages were no longer being incurred due to employees receiving another COVID-19 related benefit (for example the COVID-19 – Person with Disability Benefit or the COVID-19 wage subsidy, both offered by the Government of Malta to prevent redundancies). However, it was clarified that employers could apply to reduce the hours of work of employees within this scheme (generally from 40 hours to 20 hours per week). For this to occur however, employers are to provide a copy of their correspondence with the Director of Employment and Industrial Relations, following which, the A2E will assess the request on a case by case basis and will inform the employer accordingly.","Between 2015 and 2019, 778 unique employers applied for the funding of 2,029 participants. 1,310 of these participants engaged with 573 unique employers, remained active in the scheme with a total of €7.9 million being committed.

Therefore, the consequences of the COVID-19 on Croatian economy should be seen primarily through this economic sector and its spill-over effects on the whole economy. As the share of exports in Croatia's GDP, primarily due to positive trends in tourism, has increased over the last 10 years, so its GDP has become increasingly sensitive to changes in exports. Negative factors, as a sudden decrease in exports, due to an exogenous event like the COVID-19, could have a very fast adverse result in significant GDP decline. Tourism is very sensitive to safety and health because if tourists do not feel safe, they do not travel. Moreover, the tourist sector is experiencing growing recruitment problems.

However, the social partners fear that even though there is no formal way of forcing an employee to take a test, employers can still pressure the employee in other ways to undertake a test;* With regard to privacy, such medical information can only be shared between the test agency involved and the employee in question. The employer has no right to acquire information of that nature;* The social partners do not believe that testing alone is sufficient to prevent the spreading of the virus in workplaces. Tests are not 100% conclusive in nature and there is still a relatively high degree of false negatives in test results. In addition, they only provide insight at that moment in time and not even in the near future, if the employee comes in contact with other people.* Finally the social partners plead for a better cooperation and implementation of medical services at work (like occupational physicians) within the general healthcare in the context of contact tracing. Currently, general healthcare and occupational healthcare cooperate too little, leading to inefficiency and errors.","The advice of the High Council on Prevention and Protection at Work is not that concrete that it can be quantified;  neither the advice against testing at the workplace, nor the necessity for improved communication and cooperation between the general medical field and occupational healthcare.",Company / Companies,,No special funding required,"The statement is formulated by the High Council, which consists of both (representative) employers' associations as well as the representative trade unions.

It must also be ensured that sanitary rules are complied with when new teams of subcontractors enter the works;* Place informational posters from the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) in the works, with translation into several languages, according to the nationalities of the workers.* Intensify the action of those responsible for work safety, namely with regard to the promotion, dissemination, inspection and permanent information of all the COVID-19 pandemic prevention procedures.* Keep information up to date for all workers and for all other players on the job, taking into account their legitimate concerns, seeking to support them in solving problems they detect or persist; * Maintain regular communication between workers, companies and other contracting entities, namely on the conditions of hygiene, safety and health in the workplace.**ACCOMMODATION AND HOUSING CONDITIONS:**To guarantee housing and housing conditions for all workers, which ensure the conditions of hygiene and safety for themselves, their families and the communities where they operate, in interconnection with Social Security services and municipal entities.","It is not mentioned, but the proposed measures would cover, should cover all companies and workers in the construction sector.",Trade unions,Sector specific set of companies,No special funding required,"The 40 measures/recommendations proposed are a initiative of the union Federation FEVICCOM taken in June 2020.

FEVICOMM recommendations converge and reinforce to a large extent the regulations and guidelines of national health and security authorities concerning the construction sector;  with which also converge the recommendations of the two employer federations of the construction sector AECOPS and AICCOPN (COVID-19: Recomendações para empresas e trabalhadores) updated in July 2020. What is very relevant in FEVICCOM initiative is that it contributes to raise awareness and reinforces guidance over health and safety procedures and conditions when cooperation is most needed; it suggests  a closer follow-up of the company practices in the sector by national authorities and requires requires greater corporate accountability for compliance with health and safety procedures in the workplace but also the environmental (transport of workers and housing conditions). Furthermore, it stresses the critical need for companies compliance with workers information and consultation rights and dialogue with trade unions and employee representatives, including health and safety representatives.

The Trade Union of Workers in the Trade Sector (ZSSS-SDTS) tries to take this opportunity for a permanent closure of shops on Sundays. If realized, it would bring an end to a long-lasting public debate on the opening hours of shops on Sundays (for more information see the article [‘Slovenia: Social partners in favour of partial Sunday opening hours in retail’](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/is/publications/article/2018/slovenia-social-partners-in-favour-of-partial-sunday-opening-hours-in-retail). The debate began in 2003 with a referendum which led to a ban on Sunday shopping. However, the referendum decision was never carried out as retail companies’ appeal to the Constitutional Court managed to defer its implementation","With the end of epidemics, the government lifted many restrictions on business activities, but a ban on Sunday shopping remained in place. The Trade Union of Workers in the Trade Sector (ZSSS-SDTS) launched a proposal to transform a temporary ban on Sunday shopping into a permanent one and, in this way, implement a public referendum’s decision from 2003.On the initiative of a trade union, The Left party (Slov. Levica) gave a law amendment into the parliamentary procedure. The draft law seemingly had wide support among parliamentary deputies from the opposition as well as coalition parties. In the mid-July, the draft law successfully passed the discussion in the Parliamentary Committee for the Economy. Only the Modern Centre Party and the government spokesperson openly expressed their concerns that the draft law infringes the entrepreneurial freedom of retailers. However, the second parliamentary reading of the draft law showed that many deputies gave their support in bad faith.In the name of retailers, unsatisfied with the continued prohibition on Sunday opening of shops, the Slovenian Chamber of Commerce appealed to the Constitutional Court. On the ground of this appeal, the government lifted restriction on Sunday opening on 23 July 2020. From then on, all shops are again open on Sundays.The parliament will decide on the draft law in September 2020.

According to this model, workers, mainly employed in sales services and logistics, will be employed full time, 40 hours a week, but will work fewer hours, on average 30 hours a week. Discount retailer Höfer emphasises the benefits for workers from this model, better work-life balance and more time spent with their families. Höfer launched the new employment model with paid advertisements in daily newspapers Delo and Dnevnik on 10 August 2020. ","The new employment model targets workers in sales services and logistics. It is important to note that majority of them are already part-time workers, working 30 hours a week on average. Although their payment per hour is high compared to the average payment in the retail sector, these workers receive lower wage and also have lower pension security. Their pension insurance is proportional to part-time employment, so their annual contributions for pension security are equivalent to eight months of full pension insurance and these workers risk old-age poverty. Moreover, researchers point out the problem of a high intensity of work due to which workers carry out the work of eight hours in six hours, but are paid only for six hours (Kanjuo-Mrčela in Ignjatovič, 2018).The new employment model which will requalify part-time employment into full-time employment will solve the problem of partial pension insurance. With the requalification of the employment contract, workers will also receive a full annual holiday allowance. Yet, as all other working conditions will remain the same, the new model does not solve many existing troubles, for instance, the problems of underemployment and high intensity of work. It also raises many open questions – the payment of bonuses for ‘overtime’, the right of workers to second employment as they are in fact part-time employees, full availability of workers to the employer etc.","Discount retailer Höfer will introduce the new employment model with a test period from September to December 2020. In this period, the company will test the reactions of employees and adapt a model if necessary. Until the end of 2020, a quarter of all employees in sales and logistics will be included in the Höfer (full-time) employment model. The transitional period will be concluded by the end of 2021 when more than 1,200 employees (75% of all workers) in sales and logistics are expected to be included in the ‘Höfer (full-time)’ employment model.

Contrary to his expectations, the Slovenian Democratic Party of Janez Janša managed to form a new coalition with the two Šarec’s coalition partners. The new right-wing government came into office on 13 March 2020, a day after the outbreak of COVID-19. This caused a two-month halt of the main tripartite body (The Economic and Social Council) in the period when the key ‘anti-corona laws’ (#PKP1 and #PKP2) were adopted.","When Janez Janša’s government took office, it should have appointed its representatives in the Economic and Social Council; instead it was postponed, and, as a result, practically blocked the main tripartite body from 13 March to 30 April 2020 (Podvršič, 2020) from fulfilling its role. As a consequence of the government’s inactivity, social dialogue was practically non-existent in the period when the first two ‘anti-corona laws’ (#PKP1 and #PKP2) were adopted. Trade unions and employer organizations could only send comments on draft laws under great time pressure. They had a day or two to comment on the draft laws in writings but did not receive any response to their inputs and most of their proposals were not taken into consideration in final laws. On 20 April, all seven confederations of trade unions demanded the restoration of social dialogue and the re-establishing of the Economic and Social Council. The government appointed its representatives on 30 April, two days after the adoption of the second ‘anti-corona law’.  The first meeting of the Council was held on 15 May 2020.

The trade union underlines the importance to reinforce economic stimulus policies aiming to increase the demand of households, as well as to avoid austerity policies. Measures also emphasise a stabilising effect of social security systems and strong labour legislation. It opposes a privatisation of state services.","The recommendations of the OGBL cover five types of measures:**1. The exit of the crisis**So as to avoid situations of social precariousness and reinforce employment, all crisis-linked derogations from labour law should be stopped. Other recommendations concern the maintaining of the extension of periods of absence due to incapacity of work, employment (leave for family reasons, teleworking for cross border workers, …). Also, specific attention should be paid to gender equity in sectors that are specifically hit by the crisis. **2. Employment retention**Employment retention instruments are aimed to avoid mass unemployment: among them figure the extension of short-time work, access to the minimum social income and its increase. In addition, deadlines for social plans and the reinforcement of social dialogue in enterprises should be considered.**3. The purchasing power of households**OGBL put forward to increase the purchasing power of households by re-examining and increase social benefits such as the indexation of family allowances, the increase of access and amount of rent subsidies, tax credits for vulnerable populations, and the increase of the minimum income. **4. The re-examination of tax measures**OGBL considers that the government must avoid any tax measures that increase the burden on households or reduce the premiums of employees. **5. Financing the crisis**OGBL is not opposed to a new state loan to finance the crisis. Yet, it favours a longer suspension of the budgetary rules at EU level and the creation of a national solidarity fund. Another important point is that the government should not touch the pension fund and pay attention to the financing of the health system.

Where the first version of the agreement focused on setting wage regimes in budgetary health establishments, the updated version also covered aspects such as teleworking, overtime, and additional occupational health and safety measures. For example, the document provides for the payment of wage supplements for extra work and adverse working conditions, as well as the possibility to work remotely for a certain period of time.

EE-2020-16/1122,Postponement of collectively agreed wage increases in transport sector,Kollektiivsete töötasukokkulepete edasilükkamine transpordisektoris,Estonia,Applies nationwide,04/13/2020,01/01/2022,Temporary,Bipartite collective agreements,New aspects included into existing measure,Employment protection and retention,Wage flexibility ,09/15/2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures, the transport sector was hit hard. Countries’ borders were closed, which strongly affected the freight transport. It also had an enormous impact on tourism resulting in almost zero income for passenger transport companies. In Estonia, one of the largest passenger transport company is Tallink Group that operates in passenger water transport sector in Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Latvia. Tallink as well as freight road transport companies made use of the wage subsidy provided by the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, but as the measure was temporary and the difficulties in the sector remain, additional auxiliary measures were needed to keep the business running and retain employment. To keep the businesses afloat and retain employment, changes to collective agreements in the transport sector were made. There are two sector-level collective agreements concluded in the road transport sector – one for passenger transport and the other for freight transport, and there are several collective agreements concluded in water transport between Tallink Group and its subsidiaries and seamen's union.  ","In road transport sector, regarding passenger transport, on 13 January 2020, a new collective agreement for 2020-2023 was signed, which should have increased the wage of bus drivers as of April 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, it was agreed in April that the wage increase would be postponed until June 2020. Regarding freight transport, a collective agreement was signed in 2019 for 2019-2022, according to which the wage of truck drivers should have increased in May 2020. It was agreed, however, that the wage increase would be postponed by a year. In passenger water transport, similar measures were used in Tallink Group by its subsidiaries. In case of service personnel the wage increase was postponed to 2022, but in case of technical personnel the postponement agreement was not reached. Additional changes included different aspects of different agreements. For example, it was agreed that shortening the work days length, changing the calculation periods for banked working time, paying hourly wage instead of daily wages, guaranteeing a gross monthly wage, and making sure the work time is divided as equally as possible. However, additional negotiations are on their way, as the condition for freezing the wage increase was that there would be no redundancies, and if redundancies would take place, the consent to postpone the wage agreement will become null and void. Tallink has now announced the dismissals of more than 1,000 employees, which is enormous number in Estonian context. ","The collective agreements of Tallink Group and its subsidiaries cover more than 1,000 employees. In road transport sector, the numbe rof employees was around 22,000 in 2019.",Social partners jointly; Trade unions; Company / Companies,Employees in standard employment,No special funding required,No reactions available.,,,Yes,Not specified,H49 Land transport and transport via pipelines; H50 Water transport,No,,,https://emsa.ee/2020/08/04/kollektiivlepingu-ajutine-muutmine-hansaliini-tootajatele/; https://emsa.ee/2020/09/14/viking-xprs-kollektiivleping-on-ajutiselt-muudetud/; https://majandus24.postimees.ee/7055396/meremeeste-ametiuhing-uue-kokkuleppeta-ei-saa-tuhandet-tootajat-koondada; https://uus.etta.ee/sektsioonid/bussisektsioon/soitjateveo-uldtookokkulepe-2020-2023
